Abstract

Cellular electrophysiology experiments, important for understanding cardiac arrhythmia mechanisms, are usually performed
with channels expressed in non myocytes, or with non-human myocytes. Differences between cell types and species affect
results. Thus, an accurate model for the undiseased human ventricular action potential (AP) which reproduces a broad range
of physiological behaviors is needed. Such a model requires extensive experimental data, but essential elements have been
unavailable. Here, we develop a human ventricular AP model using new undiseased human ventricular data: Ca2+ versus
voltage dependent inactivation of L-type Ca2+ current (ICaL); kinetics for the transient outward, rapid delayed rectifier (IKr),
Na+/Ca2+ exchange (INaCa), and inward rectifier currents; AP recordings at all physiological cycle lengths; and rate
dependence and restitution of AP duration (APD) with and without a variety of specific channel blockers. Simulated APs
reproduced the experimental AP morphology, APD rate dependence, and restitution. Using undiseased human mRNA and
protein data, models for different transmural cell types were developed. Experiments for rate dependence of Ca2+ (including
peak and decay) and intracellular sodium ([Na+]i) in undiseased human myocytes were quantitatively reproduced by the
model. Early afterdepolarizations were induced by IKr block during slow pacing, and AP and Ca2+ alternans appeared at rates
.200 bpm, as observed in the nonfailing human ventricle. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK) modulated
rate dependence of Ca2+ cycling. INaCa linked Ca2+ alternation to AP alternans. CaMK suppression or SERCA upregulation
eliminated alternans. Steady state APD rate dependence was caused primarily by changes in [Na+]i, via its modulation of the
electrogenic Na+/K+ ATPase current. At fast pacing rates, late Na+ current and ICaL were also contributors. APD shortening
during restitution was primarily dependent on reduced late Na+ and ICaL currents due to inactivation at short diastolic
intervals, with additional contribution from elevated IKr due to incomplete deactivation.

Introduction

The first step toward preventing sudden cardiac death is under-
standing the basic mechanisms of ventricular arrhythmias at the
level of ion channel currents and the single myocyte action potential
(AP), using both experiments[1] and theoretical models[2].
Obtaining ventricular myocytes from human hearts for the study
of arrhythmia mechanisms is both rare and technically challenging.
Consequently, these mechanisms are usually studied with human
channels expressed in non myocytes, or with non human (rodent or
other mammalian) myocytes. However, these approaches have
limitations, because functionally important accessory subunits and
anchoring proteins native to ventricular myocytes[3] are absent in
expression systems, and even among mammalian ventricular
myocytes, ion channel kinetics[4,5,6] and consequently arrhythmia
mechanisms are strongly species dependent.

These issues limit the applicability of results from animal studies
to human cardiac electrophysiology and clinical arrhythmia[7].
Measurements from undiseased human ventricular myocytes are a
requisite for understanding human cell electrophysiology. Here,
we present data from over 100 undiseased human hearts for steady
state rate dependence, and restitution of
the ventricular AP.
Importantly, we also obtained essential new measurements for
the L-type Ca2+
exchange
current
from undiseased human ventricle. These previously
unavailable data are critically important for correct formulation
of mathematical models for simulation of electrophysiology and
cellular arrhythmia mechanisms[8]. Using the new data together
with previously published experiments, a detailed mathematical
model of undiseased human ventricular myocyte electrophysiology
and Ca2+
cycling was developed and thoroughly validated over the
entire range of physiological frequencies. This model is referred to

Author Summary

Understanding and preventing irregular heart rhythms
that can lead to sudden death begins with basic research
regarding single cell electrical behavior. Most of these
studies are performed using non-human cells. However,
differences between human and non-human cell proper-
ties affect experimental
results and invoke different
mechanisms of responses to heart rate changes and to
drugs. Using essential and previously unavailable experi-
mental data from human hearts, we developed and
validated an accurate mathematical model of the human
cardiac cell. We compared cellular behaviors and mecha-
nisms to an extensive dataset including measurements
from more than 100 undiseased human hearts. The model
responds to pacing rate and premature beats as in
experiments. At very fast pacing rates, beat to beat
alternations in intracellular calcium concentration and
electrophysiological behavior were observed as in human
heart experiments. In presence of drug block, arrhythmic
behavior was observed. The basis for these and other
important rhythmic and irregular rhythm behaviors was
investigated using the model.

as the ORd (O’Hara-Rudy dynamic) model throughout the text.
Model comparisons are conducted with the ten Tusscher-Panfilov
(TP) model[9], and the Grandi-Bers (GB) model[10].

The ORd model was used to describe cellular electrophysiology
mechanisms specific to human ventricular myocytes. Underlying
mechanisms of AP duration (APD) rate dependence and APD
restitution were investigated. The effects of Ca2+
/calmodulin-
dependent protein kinase II (CaMK) on known ionic current and
Ca2+
cycling targets were incorporated and studied. Early
afterdepolarizations (EADs) and alternans were reproduced by
the model. These are important arrhythmogenic phenomena that
must be reproduced in order to study the mechanisms of cardiac
arrhythmias in human and simulate clinical interventions such as
drugs.

Results

Throughout, new undiseased human ventricle experimental
data are represented by white circles or white squares for isolated
myocyte or small tissue preparation measurements, respectively.
Previously published nonfailing human ventricle experimental
data are shown with black symbols. Other data classification
schemes are provided case by case in figure legends.

Formulation, Validation and Properties of Simulated
Currents: L-type Ca2+ Current (ICaL)

Data for ICaL in the undiseased human ventricle are from
Magyar et al.[11] and Fulop et al.[12] (both at 37uC, model
validation in Figure 1C). Magyar et al. measured steady state
activation, steady state inactivation, and the current voltage (I–V)
curve. Fulop et al. measured recovery from inactivation. However,
neither study separated Ca2+
dependent inactivation (CDI) from
voltage dependent inactivation (VDI). In fact, no published data
are available which separate CDI and VDI in the undiseased or
nonfailing human ventricle. For this measurement, we made new
recordings in undiseased human ventricular myocytes at 37uC
(Figure 1, current traces and white circles).

Measurements were carried out with Ca2+
allowing both CDI and VDI, or with Ba2+
allowing only VDI. Results for Sr2+

as charge carrier,
as charge carrier,
were similar to those for Ba2+
.

Undiseased Human Cardiac Action Potential

From holding potential of 260 mV, 75 ms steps were to potentials
ranging from 240 to +50 mV (10 mV increments, 3 second
interpulse interval, Figure 1A). 75 ms was sufficient for compar-
ison of CDI and VDI, since it is in the early phase of decay in
which CDI effects are most prominent[13]. Simulated current
traces for CDI+VDI and for VDI–alone were similar to the
experiments.

Fractional remaining current (FRC, at time t and voltage Vm,
FRC(t,Vm) = I(t,Vm)/Ipeak(Vm)) quantified the voltage and time
inactivation for comparison between charge
dependence of
carriers. Figure 1B compares FRC for Ba2+
(experiments top left,
simulations right), and Ca2+
(experiments bottom left, simulations
right). With Ba2+
as the charge carrier, FRC monotonically
decreased with increasing voltage at all times after peak current.
This finding is consistent with dependence of
inactivation on
voltage alone. In contrast, for Ca2+
currents, FRC did not decrease
monotonically with increasing voltage. Rather, Ca2+
current FRC
curves appear to be effectively voltage independent. FRC for
CDI+VDI was statistically different from FRC for VDI-alone at
the more hyperpolarized potentials (220 to 0 mV, unpaired two-
tailed t-test, p,0.01). Ca2+
ions caused additional inactivation at
these voltages, where VDI-alone was relatively weak. Since the
only difference between Ca2+
cases was the charge
carrier, it follows that Ca2+
ions themselves were the source of the
additional inactivation. This is evidence that currents carried by
Ba2+
currents inactivate
due to both VDI and CDI[14]. There is evidence that Ba2+
can
cause ion dependent inactivation[15]. However, Ba2+
-dependent
inactivation was estimated to be 100-fold weaker than CDI[16],
and its effects were not appreciable in FRC experiments.

inactivate due to VDI only, while Ca2+

and Ba2+

To modulate VDI versus CDI in the model, the n gate was
introduced, the value of which represents the fraction of channels
operating in CDI mode. Under physiological conditions, ICaL
inactivation is caused by a combination of both CDI and VDI.
That is, n is between 0 (all VDI) and 1 (all CDI). This model was
based on experiments by Kim et al.[17], where CDI was observed
to function as a faster VDI, activated by elevated Ca2+
. Thus, both
CDI and VDI are voltage dependent. The rate of decay in CDI
mode is faster than that in VDI mode. The Mahajan et al.[18] and
Decker et al.[19] ICaL models work similarly.

The n gate is diagrammed in Figure 1E. Rates k1 and k-1
represent binding/unbinding of Ca2+
to channel bound calmodulin
(CaM)[20]. There are four identical binding sites. Rates k2 and k-2
represent activation/deactivation of CDI mode (black circle,
asterisk), which occurs when all Ca2+
binding sites are occupied.
We considered that the four Ca2+
binding transitions are in rapid
equilibrium and solved the reversible two state reaction of Ca2+
/
CaM binding and CDI mode activation to obtain the differential
equation describing the n gate (Supplement Text S1, page 10).

In both CDI and VDI modes, there are two weighted time
constants for inactivation (time constant weighting described in
Methods). We determined time constants for CDI and n gate
kinetics in an attempt to represent the shape and magnitude of the
FRC measurements
(i.e. CDI reduced FRC, particularly at
negative potentials). Time constants for VDI gates were deter-
mined by inactivation of Ba2+
currents (Figure 1C). AP clamp
simulations using the formulated ICaL model were similar to AP
the 1 mM
clamp experiments, where ICaL was defined as
nisoldipine sensitive current (Figure 1D). Specifically, currents
showed spike and dome morphology. In experiments, peak current
was 23.0 mA/mF.
It was 22.7 mA/mF in simulations. Fast
inactivation was 2.5 fold faster when phosphorylated by CaMK,
similar to the Decker et al. dog ICaL model[19] and as measured
experimentally[21].

Transient Outward K+ Current (Ito)

The model for Ito was formulated based on newly measured
experimental data. The measurements were from isolated
undiseased human ventricular myocytes at 37uC (Figure 2A, white
circles), and were carried out with the addition of 1 mM nisoldipine
to the standard bath solution (see Methods) to block ICaL. The
holding potential was 290 mV. Currents were activated by a
300 ms step to various potentials. Inactivation time constants were
determined from exponential fits to decay of these traces. To
measure steady state inactivation, 500 ms steps from 290 mV to
various potentials were followed by test pulses to 50 mV. Recovery
from inactivation was determined at 290 mV, using P1/P2 pulses
of 200 ms to 50 mV at varying interpulse intervals in a double
pulse protocol.

The time constant for activation was determined by fitting time
to peak from a digitized current trace (Amos et al.[22], their
Figure 12C, in undiseased human ventricle at 37uC; ta = 2.645 ms
at Vm = +40 mV). Greenstein et al.[23] showed time to peak for
hKv4.3 expressed in mouse fibroblast cells. The model provides a
qualitative match to these data (considering temperature and
expression system differences). That is, the model activation time
constant decreases from a peak value of 6.5 to 1.5 ms in near
linear fashion with increasing voltage from 220 to 60 mV.

I–V averages. However,

The inactivation gate has two time constants, each with voltage
dependent weighting. Inactivation kinetics and the I–V curve are
accurate to the experimental data. A small divergence between
simulations and experiments was observed at hyperpolarized
potentials along the I–V curve (simulated current was less than in
experiments). This may be due to the fact that experimentally
measured currents were small and difficult to measure at these
potentials. In fact, current was not measureable in 21, 11, 5, and 1
out of 23 cells at Vm = 240, 230, 220, and 210 mV,
respectively. Currents with zero values were not included in the
experimental
these currents were
included in averages for obtaining steady state activation and
steady state inactivation curves in the model. This prevented over
representation of the window current (small, appearing late during
phase-3 of the AP, shown later). The conductance of the Ito model
was set so that phase-1 behavior of the simulated AP would be
similar to undiseased human endocardium experiments (small in
endocardium; maximum value ,1 mA/mF). Measured endocar-
dial APs showed rapid phase-1 repolarization, but did not show
positive time derivatives during phase-1 (true notching was
generally not observed). Thus, model Ito conductance was set to
the maximum level which did not violate these observations
(,1 mA/mF peak current at 1 Hz pacing).

CaMK effects on Ito were incorporated based on measurements
by Tessier et al.[24] and Wagner et al.[25]. As in Tessier et al.,
CaMK shifted the voltage dependence of steady state activation

10 mV in the depolarization direction, and the time constant for
development of inactivation was increased (multiplicative factor fit
to match the voltage dependent increase). Wagner et al. showed
that the time constant for recovery from inactivation was affected
by CaMK (,2 fold faster).

The INaCa model was formulated using measurements from
undiseased human ventricular myocytes at 37uC (Figure 2B, white
circles). The model was based on the framework established by
Kang and Hilgemann[26], which allows for unlikely occurrence of
exchange. The Hilgemann model
inward Na
+
shows Na
exchange stoichiometry slightly greater than 3.0,
as has been observed by others[27,28]. Though the Hilgemann
model is mechanistically novel in this way, it can still reproduce all
and voltage dependent properties observed by Weber
Na
et al.[29] in the nonfailing human ventricle. Compare Hilgemann
and Weber data to our simulated reproductions in Supplement
Figures S1, S2 and S3 in Text S1. As in the Faber-Rudy[30] and
Hund-Decker-Rudy models[19,31], we included 20% of
the
exchanger in the Ca2+
diffusion subspace[32,33]. The choice to
include 20% in the subspace in human is validated based on its
effect on the rate dependence of peak [Ca2+
]i
in
Supplement Figure S17 in Text S1). Values above or below
20% disrupt the demonstrated correspondence of peak [Ca2+
]i
and Ca2+
rate dependence with experiments (see section on Na

Inward Rectifier K+ Current (IK1)

The model for IK1 was constructed based primarily on new
experimental data, measured at 37uC in undiseased isolated
human ventricular myocytes as the 0.5 mM BaCl2 sensitive
current (Figure 2C, white circles). Current was elicited with steps
from 290 mV to various potentials for 300 ms. The current that
remained at the end of the steps was recorded as IK1.

Two gates were used in the model: RK1, the instantaneous
rectification gate, and xK1, the time dependent inactivation gate.
Importantly, previous models[9,10,34,35] have ignored both
inactivation gating, and detailed [K
IK1
(exception, IK1 equations by Fink et al.[36]). There are nonfailing
human ventricular measurements which we utilized to include
these effects[37,38].

of inactivation. We introduced the time dependent xK1 gate, based
on these data. As was shown experimentally, both V1/2 and the
slope factor for inactivation depend linearly on [K

constant for inactivation was based on measurements in nonfailing
human ventricular myocytes by Konarzewska et al.[38] (their

Rapid Delayed Rectifier K+ Current (IKr)

The model for IKr was constructed using experimental data
measured in isolated undiseased human ventricular myocytes at
37uC (Figure 3A, white circles). Measurements were carried out
with/without addition of 1 mM E-4031 to the standard bath
solution in order to obtain the difference current. Tail currents
were elicited by stepping from 240 mV to various potentials for
1000 ms, and then stepping back down to 240 mV. The
deactivation time constant was determined by fitting the tail
current decay. The time constant for activation was found by
stepping from 240 mV to various potentials for various durations
preceding a step back to 240 mV. The rate with which the
envelope of
tail currents developed at different voltages was
measured with an exponential fit to obtain the time constant for
activation. Since this process was well fit by a single exponential,
we made the fast and slow time constants in the model converge
on the activation limb, at depolarized potentials. The steady state
activation curve was determined from the I–V curve, after dividing
by the driving force, assuming maximal activation at the time of
peak tail current. Slow deactivation of IKr
(experiments and
simulations, Figure 3B), suggests its participation in AP shortening
during steady state pacing at fast rate and at short diastolic
intervals during restitution; this hypothesis will be explored in a
later section. The fast inactivation (rectification, instantaneous in
the model) RKr gate was determined so that current profile
matched experiments using a human AP voltage
clamp
(Figure 3C). Important features of the experimental AP clamp
trace that the model reproduced include 1) the early recovery
phase, where approximately half maximal current appeared by the
beginning of the AP plateau, followed by 2) quasi-linear current
increase until peak current was reached during late phase-3 of the
AP.

Since enzymes used to disaggregate myocytes can significantly
degrade IKr[40], conductance was scaled to provide correct
APD90 in control and with IKr block, measured in small tissue
preparations. Indeed, APD90 was a function of IKr conductance
(parameter sensitivity, Supplement Figure S15 in Text S1). As in
undiseased human ventricle experiments[39], IKr was voltage
dependent, but not pacing rate dependent (Supplement Figure S5
in Text S1).

Slow Delayed Rectifier K+ Current (IKs)

Data from Vira´g et al.[41], measured in isolated undiseased
human ventricular myocytes at 37uC, were used to construct the
model for IKs (Figure 3D). The model has two gates: xs1 and xs2. The
xs1 gate is responsible for activation. Deactivation was controlled by
xs2. Activation/deactivation separation was based on the fact that
activation was much slower than deactivation. Setting tx1..tx2 at
hyperpolarized potentials, where deactivation dominated, and
tx2,,tx1 at depolarized potentials, where activation dominated,
allowed for separation of these processes as two gates. As in the case
of IKr, it is understood that IKs is damaged (reduced) by enzymatic
disaggregation of myocytes[42]. Therefore, we used IKs specific
drug block (1 mM HMR-1556) effects on APD90, measured in small
tissue preparations, to determine the correct conductance. Ca2+
dependence of IKs was incorporated based on measurements by
Tohse et al.[43]. The effect of this dependence was negligible under
physiological Ca2+

concentration conditions.

Fast Na+ Current

Fast INa was formulated using nonfailing human ventricular
data from Sakakibara et al.[44] (Figure 4A). Since Sakakibara
experiments were performed at 17uC, a temperature adjustment
was used to obtain the final model equations, representing
behavior at 37uC. The effect of temperature on steady state
gating was shown by Nagatomo et al.[45]. For activation, V1/2
shift with temperature change from 23 to 33uC was +4.3 mV. For
inactivation, the shift was +4.7 mV. We shifted V1/2 by twice these
amounts, assuming linearity (adjust to 37uC from data taken at
17uC, a change of 20uC; Nagatomo showed a change of 10uC).
Time constants were adjusted to 37uC using Q10. We set Q10 = 2
since Q10 was given as ‘‘about two’’ by Nagatomo.

Hanck and Sheets[46] documented a shift in V1/2 with the
passage of time after patch clamp commencement. For activation,
the shift was 20.47 mV/min. It was 20.41 mV/min for in-
activation. Sakakibara reported the time elapsed between patching
and measurement for steady state activation and inactivation as
between 10 and 20 min, ,15 min for both. Thus, we reversed the
time dependent shifts in V1/2.

CaMK effects on INa were based on available data[47]. We took
into account the measured 26.2 mV V1/2 shift in steady state
inactivation, the roughly 3-fold slowing of current decay, and the
1.46-fold slowing of recovery from inactivation.

The non-temperature adjusted model

I–V curve matches
Sakakibara data at 17uC. We determined appropriate channel
conductance at 37uC based on conduction velocity, and maximum
dVm/dt. Conduction velocity in a one dimensional fiber simulation
was 45 cm/s during 1 Hz pacing, consistent with available (dog)
experiments[48]. It was 70 cm/s when stimulated from quiescence,
consistent with in vivo measurements
in nonfailing human
hearts[49]. Maximum dVm/dt was 254 mV/ms in single cells at
1 Hz pacing, consistent with measurements from nonfailing human
ventricular myocytes at 37uC (234628 mV/ms)[50].

Late Na+ Current

Data used in the formulation of late INa were from Maltsev
et al.[51], measured in the nonfailing human ventricle (Figure 4B),
+
functionally defined in experiments and simulations as the Na
current remaining after 200 ms from the onset of depolarization.
Steady state activation was derived from the I–V curve (current
divided by driving force, then normalized). The time constant for
activation of late INa was identical to that for fast INa. It is not
possible to measure the time to peak for late INa because of the
interfering effects of the much larger INa. However, in the model
scheme, the measurement is irrelevant for the same reason.

The hL gate is responsible for both development of and recovery
from inactivation. The time constant
for development was
adjusted using Q10 = 2.2, as measured by Maltsev et al.[52]
(hNav1.5 channels expressed heterologously). The time constant

was voltage independent[51]. Maltsev et al.[51] reported a
maximum late INa of 20.356 pA/pF in nonfailing human
ventricular myocytes (average current between 200 and 220 ms
during step to 230 mV from 2120 mV, their Table 2, donor
heart average). We scaled the Maltsev I–V curve to the donor
value and used it to determine the model conductance.

+

We do not consider fast and late Na

currents to be separate
channels. Rather, they have long been understood to represent
different gating modes (experiments[52], and simulations by our
group[53]), separated functionally in time. In experiments, and in
simulated reproductions of experiments, late INa was functionally
defined as the INa current persisting 200 ms after onset of
depolarization. CaMK dependence was implemented (26.2 mV
V1/2 shift
in steady state inactivation, and 3-fold slowing of
inactivation time constant, as measured[47]).

Transmural Heterogeneity

Changes in mRNA and protein expression across the transmural
wall using undiseased human ventricles were measured[67,68,69].
Functional data for transmural changes in Ito were measured in
nonfailing human ventricular myocytes[70]. These results were
compiled to create a complete dataset for transmural differences
between endocardial (endo), mid-myocardial (M), and epicardial
(epi) cell types. We considered transmural differences in Nav1.5,
Cav1.2, HERG1, KvLQT1, Kir2.1, NCX1, Na/K ATPase, Kv1.5,
RyR2, SERCA2, and CALM3 to be represented in the model by
late INa, ICaL, IKr, IKs, IK1, INaCa, INaK, IKb, Jrel, Jup, and CMDN,
respectively. Whenever an expression ratio was not available, we
chose unity. Using this analysis, models for M and epi cells were
derived from the thoroughly validated endo model (Figure 10A–
10D; equations on page 19 in Supplement Text S1).

In Figure 10E1, our experimental measurements for endo
APD90 were scaled by M/endo and epi/endo APD90 ratios
measured by Drouin et al.[50] and compared to simulations.
Drouin experiments did not show results for CL,1000 ms. Epi
simulations seem to deviate from Drouin experiments at faster
pacing rates. However, epi simulations were consistent with
nonfailing human epi experimental measurements at fast pacing
rates (CL ,1000 ms) recorded using optical mapping by Glukhov
et al.[71] (panel E2). The rate dependence of simulated AP
morphology in the different cell types (Figure 10F) was similar to
Drouin recordings[50]. Relative shape and duration of simulated
transmural APs were also consistent with those recorded by
Glukhov et al.[71] from the heart of a 20 year old healthy human
male (Supplement Figure S9 in Text S1). The transmural
repolarization gradient direction was such that the pseudo-ECG
T-wave was upright and rate dependent[72] as expected
(Figure 10G).

produce an EAD following the same protocol
(CL = 4000 ms),
even with complete block of IKr (100%).

EADs in the ORd model were caused by IKr block induced
prolongation of
the time at plateau voltages, allowing ICaL
reactivation. When ICaL recovery was prevented, the EAD was
eliminated (inactivation gate clamping protocol, Figure 11B).
This mechanism is the same as shown previously in other

Pacing at rates faster than 230 ms in the model caused 2 to 1 block
(i.e. failed APs every other beat), because APD began to encroach
upon the pacing cycle length, leading to enhanced refractoriness of

current due to incomplete repolarization.

+

Since Koller measurements were performed in intact hearts,
electrotonic coupling effects would have played a role. Therefore,
simulations in a strand of 100 coupled endo cells were conducted
to test whether alternans occurred in coupled tissue as well.
Indeed, during CL = 280 ms
steady state pacing, alternans
developed in the multicellular fiber (results shown in Supplement
Figure S10 in Text S1).

As in Livshitz et al.[77], beat to beat alternans in the Ca2+
subsystem were the cause of the APD alternans in the model.
Longer APs coincided with larger Ca2+
transients. For steady state
pacing at 250 ms pacing cycle length (shown in Figure 14A), we
found that clamping the subspace Ca2+
concentration to either the
odd or even beat waveforms eliminated alternans, but clamping of
the voltage, myoplasmic Ca2+
, ICaL, or INaCa did not eliminate
alternans (odd or even beat clamp, not shown).

Cutler et al.[78] demonstrated that 30% SERCA upregulation
in our human model, a 20%
eliminated alternans. Similarly,
increase in Jup magnitude eliminated alternans
(shown in
Supplement Figure S11 in Text S1). CaMK suppression also
eliminated alternans in the model
(Figure 14A and 14B, gray

CaMK suppression. However, the peak Ca2+

Currents Participating in Steady State APD Rate
Dependence and APD Restitution

In order to describe the mechanisms underlying steady state rate
dependence and restitution of the APD in the model, it is instructive
to first systematically determine which currents participate in these
phenomena. In Figure 15, currents were plotted versus Vm during
steady state and S1S2 restitution pacing for a variety of CLs and
DIs, respectively. If I–V curves are CL or DI independent (i.e.
curves overlap), then that current did not participate in steady state
rate dependence or restitution, respectively. Conversely,
if I–V
curves depended greatly on CL or DI, then that current played at
least some role in these phenomena.

As CL or DI decreased, fast INa, responsible for the maximum
AP upstroke velocity and maximum Vm, was reduced (see Figure 9,
and principles detailed in Luo and Rudy[79]). This is because
shortened time at
resting potential between beats prevents
complete recovery from inactivation. Thus, at fast pacing rates,
and short DIs, maximum Vm and upstroke velocity were reduced,
explaining some of what follows.

During steady state pacing, IKs was strongly rate dependent
(Figure 15A). The I–V curves were dramatically different at
different pacing CLs. However,
IKs was a relatively small
contributor to the rate dependence of APD because IKs density in

more outward at fast rates. The changes in INaK were dramatic,
and the current density was relatively large. Thus, INaK was an
important contributor to APD shortening at fast pacing rates. Late

at short DIs helped shorten the APD. The mechanism was
reduced availability due to residual inactivation at the start of the
S2 beat. ICaL was reduced for the same reason. This was evident
during the plateau. CaMK facilitation did not depend on DI
because Ca2+
accumulation (necessary for CaMK activation) is
slow, occurring only after long term pacing to steady state.
+
Similarly, Na
did not accumulate at short DIs, which kept INaK
constant. Therefore, plateau potentials and ICaL driving force
during the plateau were relatively DI independent. Just as in the
case of Na
clamp, these properties combined to allow reduced
availability of ICaL at short DI to dominate the behavior. However,
reduced maximum Vm increased the driving force during the time
of peak ICaL, which caused peak current to generally increase at
short DIs. At extreme DI of 5 ms, the slow AP upstroke (i.e.
reduced dVm/dt) caused mild ICaL inactivation coincident with

Changes in other currents (Ito, IKs and INaCa), though nonzero,

enough that early spiking helped shorten APD at very short DIs

At very short DIs, IKr played an important role in APD
restitution. In Figure 17A, the fast and slow time dependent
deactivation gates (xrfast and xrslow, respectively) were reset to their
value at DI = S1 = 1000 ms (dashed gray line, compare to control
solid black line). Deactivation of IKr is slow (Figure 3B). For
DI = S1, deactivation was complete between beats. At short DIs, it
was incomplete at
the S2 beat, enhancing IKr
availability (early IKr spiking, Figure 17B, bottom) and outward
current
to APD shortening. The enhanced
availability only mattered at very short DIs, because at these DIs
APD was short enough that increased outward current during
phase-1 of the AP affected final repolarization time. Changes to
currents during later AP phases 2 and 3 (during the plateau and
early repolarization, e.g. late INa and ICaL), generally have greater
impact on the APD. Early IKr spiking reduced maximum Vm,
which affected all other currents, including late INa and ICaL.

Comparison with Other Human Ventricular AP Models

Several

important differences exist between the ORd model
presented here and other human models (e.g. TP[9] and GB[10]
models). Notably, model differences in the rate of repolarization
and EAD formation were examined in direct comparison with
experiments (Figures 7C, and Figure 11A, respectively). Readers
wishing to simulate the human ventricular AP have a choice of
models. To help further differentiate the models, additional
comparisons are shown in Figure 18.

Undiseased human ventricular measurements of steady state
rate dependence of APD90, 70, 50 and 30 were accurately

accurate, but divergence from the measurements is large for
APD30. At fast pacing rates, GB model APD90 is accurate. Slow

were compared between models. Simulations were in single endo
cells paced to steady state at CL = 1000 ms. Of note, the TP and
GB models do not include late INa. The width of the ICaL peak and
the morphology were model dependent. It was ‘‘cigar shaped’’ in
the TP model. In the GB model, the ICaL peak was broad and
poorly defined. The ORd model ICaL peak was sharp, as seen in
undiseased human ventricle experiments (AP clamp, Figure 1D).
IKr was relatively small in the GB model, but shared a similar
morphology with the ORd model. The TP IKr morphology is
characterized by an early spike and a wider late spike. The IKs
density in the TP model was much larger than in the other models
(,10 fold larger). Density and morphology of INaCa was model
dependent. INaCa was smallest
(based on
undiseased human measurements, Figure 2B). INaK was roughly
1.5 and 2 fold greater in GB and TP models, respectively,
compared with ORd. The Ca2+
transient peak was much larger in
the TP model than in the other models, which were similar to each
other. The decay rate of [Ca2+

Discussion

Though the available undiseased human ventricle dataset has
been missing essential elements, several human ventricle AP
models have been developed and published. The Priebe and
Beuckelmann model[35] lacks human specific data for reformu-
lation of major currents, and so was based in large part on its
guinea pig predecessor[80]. The TP model[81] and updated
version[9] is easy to use, includes many reformulated currents, and
simulates physiological restitution and alternans. However, both
the TP and GB[10] models lack sufficient ICaL data for validation,
and cannot produce EADs. The GB model includes K
current
reformulations using undiseased human data for validation, but
does not produce AP or Ca2+
transient alternans. EADs and
alternans are both important mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis
and should be reproduced in simulation studies of human
arrhythmias. The Iyer et al. model[34] is based almost entirely
on data from human channels expressed in non myocytes. Though
the expressed channels are human, native myocyte ion channels in
the ventricle are composed of a variety of protein isoform
combinations, auxiliary subunits, cytoskeletal elements, and
membrane lipid composition, all of which may influence channel
behavior. Anchoring and other regulatory proteins present in
native cells also define the local environment
ICaL in
particular[82], but are not present in expression systems.

(with [K

Fink et al. modified the TP model[36] to include updated IKr
formulations, based on
and IK1
undiseased human ventricular measurements. The rate of AP
repolarization in this modified scheme is more accurate compared
with the original TP model. For these advantages, the model
sacrifices runtime speed (Markov formulation is used for IKr).
Other core issues of the TP model carry over to this modified
version (incorrect ICaL, non-physiologically large IKs, and no EAD
generation under appropriate conditions).

We believe that the new undiseased human data presented here
are essential, and substantially increase human specific model
accuracy. Due to extensive validation using these new data, our
model reproduces all of the following important physiological
behaviors: 1) CDI versus VDI inactivation of ICaL; 2) reformulat-
ed, detailed and accurate kinetics (using weighted time constants)
for Ito, INaCa, IK1, IKr, IKs,
fast INa, and late INa; 3) AP
repolarization rate from 30% to 90% repolarization; 4) APD at
all physiological pacing rates with/without block of major
currents, 5) APD restitution with/without block of delayed rectifier
currents; 6)
transmural heterogeneity causing upright pseudo-
ECG T-wave; 7) early afterdepolarizations (EADs); 8) effects of

EADs and Repolarization Rate

One of the most important aspects of the model is its close
correspondence to experimental measurements of not only
APD90, but also to APD30, 50 and 70 at all physiologically
relevant pacing rates and for S1S2 restitution. This large pool of
data has previously been unavailable. Accurate repolarization rate
(i.e. time between APD30 and 90) for the restitution protocol is
crucial
for simulating any phenomenon related to reentrant
arrhythmia, where head-tail interactions determine refractoriness
and vulnerability[83]. Use of new undiseased data for currents that
are active during the plateau and phase-3 of the AP (ICaL, INaCa,
IKr and IKs) contributed to the correct repolarization rate.

The rate of repolarization and its effects on ICaL control EAD
formation in this model, as in canonical EAD explanations
[75,84]. Failure of the TP and GB models to reproduce EADs may
be due in part to their accelerated repolarization rates (Figure 7C).
It may also be caused by inaccurate formulation of
ICaL
inactivation, developed in absence of the essential undiseased
human data presented here.

Steady State APD Rate Dependence

for

Due to the small amplitude and rapid deactivation kinetics of
IKs in the human ventricle in absence of b-adrenergic stimulation,
it does not play a major role in determining APD, APD rate
dependence, or APD restitution under basal conditions[85]
(Figure 8). This is in contrast to guinea pig ventricle, where
slower deactivation and larger amplitude IKs make it the most
important current
steady state APD rate dependence
(simulations[86] and experiments[87]). Phosphorylation by PKA
in the case of b-adrenergic stimulation greatly enhances both the
activation rate and amplitude of IKs[88]. With b-adrenergic
stimulation, IKs plays an important role in steady state APD rate
dependence[89]. Clearly, IKs is important under various circum-
stances – the AP repolarizes in human ventricle experiments even
when IKr is blocked[85], and clinical long QT syndrome type 1 is
caused by IKs loss of function[90]. Typically, isolated myocyte
patch clamp experiments underestimate IKs due to enzymatic
degradation[42]. In ORd, the role of IKs was validated using small
tissue preparations, where selective IKs block prolonged APD, but

APD Restitution

We showed that in contrast to steady state rate dependence,
[Na
]i had no effect on APD restitution. Rather, restitution was
primarily caused by the time course of recovery from inactivation
of late INa and ICaL; processes which had little effect on steady
+
clamp). At very short
state-rate dependence of APD (absent Na
DIs, slow deactivation of IKr caused increased availability and
spiking, which helped shorten the APD. APD rate dependence was
caused primarily by concentration changes, while APD restitution
was caused by gating kinetics. Previous studies have not made this
important distinction between steady state rate dependence and
restitution mechanisms in human. The role of ICaL and its
inactivation kinetics in APD restitution reiterates the primacy of
ICaL in determining basic physiological behaviors, highlighting the
importance of the new ICaL experimental data, presented here, to
model development and validation.

late INa

A role for

in restitution could not have been
hypothesized using TP or GB models, which have no late INa.
The density of late INa was constrained in the ORd model by
experiments from nonfailing human ventricular myocyte mea-
surements by Maltsev et al.[51], where the late current was
measured 200 ms after the start of
the voltage clamp step
(,0.35 mA/mF I–V curve maximum). The maximum late INa
during the free running AP model was much smaller (,0.15 mA/
mF, about half the I–V curve maximum) even at slow pacing rates,
where late INa was largest. Late current is difficult to measure
the current density was
directly, and it
late INa is small,
overestimated due to selection bias. That is,
and not all cells produced measureable late current
(2 of 3
myocytes[51]). However, we consider the model density of late INa
to be accurate based on model reproduction of experiments which
consistently showed substantial APD90 shortening following
application of 10 mM mexiletine in undiseased human myocardi-
um (90% late INa block in simulations, Figure 8A).

Ca2+ Cycling, CaMK and Alternans

Previously published human ventricle AP models have not
incorporated the CaMK signaling pathway. Our human simula-
tions show, as in dog simulations[31,77], that CaMK plays an
important role in determining frequency dependence of Ca2+
cycling (Figure 13). The model also shows that the integrated
electrophysiological consequence of CaMK effects on target
channels is minimal. That is, CaMK suppression had only minor
effects on APD rate dependence and AP morphology. At very fast
pacing (CLs ,300 ms), the Ca2+
cycling consequences of CaMK
phosphorylation were central to alternans formation. Suppression
of CaMK eliminated alternans. CaMK related findings are in
agreement with simulations using other models developed by our
group[77], models from other groups[94], and experiments[95].
However, experiments showing the effects of pharmacological
suppression of CaMK on rate dependent behaviors (e.g. by
Wehrens et al.[96] with KN-93 in rabbit) should be performed in
human ventricular myocytes to validate model predictions.

Undiseased Human Cardiac Action Potential

Transmural Heterogeneity

The method used for implementation of the transmural cell
types (M and epi cell), based on the thoroughly validated endo cell
framework, was simplistic. That is, we considered that channel
conductance was proportional to transmural gradients in mRNA
or protein expression for alpha subunits of ion channels. Only in
the case of
Ito were functional current measurement data
available[70]. Staying within error bars for mRNA or protein
data[67,68,69], channel conductances were modulated so that the
simulated transmural AP differences were
consistent with
experiments[50,71].

The effect of transmural heterogeneity of accessory b-subunits
was not considered in the transmural cell
type definitions.
However, in the case of IKs, the KCNE1 b-subunit is transmurally
heterogeneous. KCNE1 protein was about two times greater in M-
cells compared to epi cells[69]. The presence of KCNE1 carries
functional consequences 1) ,5 fold slower

activation and 2) ,5 fold larger conductance[97]. Therefore,
theoretically, twice as much KCNE1 in M-cells may increase the
variable stoichiometry ratio of KCNE1 to alpha subunit
KCNQ1[98], slowing activation and increasing conductance.
We conducted simulations to evaluate the influence of KCNE1
heterogeneity on IKs and the AP (Supplement Figure S13 and
related description in Text S1). Due to the small amplitude of
human IKs in the absence of b-adrenergic stimulation, implemen-
tation of KCNE1 heterogeneity did not appreciably affect the AP
(Supplement Figures S13 and S19 in Text S1, where transmural
APDs are shown to be relatively insensitive to changes in IKs
conductance). Interestingly, the simulated effects of KCNE1 on
activation rate and conductance offset one another. That
is,
slowed activation and larger conductance in M-cells yielded IKs
current that was remarkably close to the control case. Similar
results were found for epi cell simulations: the effects of faster
activation and reduced conductance were offsetting such that their
combined effect was minimal.

APD Accommodation

Steady state rate dependence of APD and APD restitution were
the focus of
the simulations and experiments in this study.
However, the time course of APD response to abrupt changes in
pacing rate has been shown in human by Franz et al.[99], and
simulated in the TP model by Pueyo et al.[100] as a marker for
arrhythmia risk. Simulations of APD accommodation in our
model compare favorably to Franz experiments (same pacing
protocols used in experiments were used in the simulations,
Supplement Figure S14 in Text S1). Single exponential curves
were fit to the time dependence of APD changes. For abrupt CL
reduction from 750 to 480 ms, the time constant was 250 and 284
respectively. Time

Parameter Sensitivity

As in Romero et al.[101], we performed a sensitivity analysis to
determine factors participating in important model outputs,
including 1) steady state APD90 rate dependence (Supplement

[Na
]i (Supplement Figure S18 in Text S1), and 5) transmural cell
type APD90 at steady state (Supplement Figure S19 in Text S1).
The findings from our analysis were similar to those shown by
Romero et al. using the TP human AP model[101]. That is, in
ORd and TP models, IKr and ICaL affect APD90 while ICaL, INaCa,
and INaK affect peak [Ca2+
]i. One important difference is the role
for IKs. A much larger role was played by IKs in the TP model
(,10 fold larger density than in other human models, Figure 18B).
In the TP model,
is responsible for steady state rate
dependence of the APD (shown by Grandi et al.[10]).

IKs

IKr conductance changes affect APD90 substantially in our
model. This was expected, since IKr is the largest outward current
(also in experiments, Figure 8, and in Romero’s analysis using the
TP model). Though IKr affects APD, it is not responsible for its
rate dependence. Conductance changes in INaK did not substan-
tially affect APD90 because INaK is a relatively small current. Yet,
rate dependent changes in INaK (secondary to Na
accumulation at
fast rate) were the primary determinant of APD rate dependence.
[Na
]i at different pacing rates, and thus its relative changes with
rate, was by far most sensitive to INaK conductance (Supplement
Figure S18 in Text S1). This supports our strategy for setting INaK
conductance to reproduce rate dependence of [Na
]i in nonfailing
human myocytes[57].

Computational Tractability and Model Stability

that

To keep the ORd model computationally efficient and
parameters well constrained, the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism was
used in formulating current equations. This choice was made as a
design principal with the thought
interested users can
modularly replace any current or flux with more detailed Markov
formulations of mutation or drug effects as desired (e.g.[53,66]).
Similarly, intracellular Ca2+
handling can be modified (e.g. more
spatial detail, Markov ryanodine receptor implementation), or
various signaling pathways and related effects on ion channels can
be added (e.g.[31,89,102]). The basic ORd model has 41 state
variables. In the absence of CaMK and its effects on target
currents and fluxes, the number of state variables is 31.

Exclusion of Markov models increases parameter constraint. It
also prevents the system of differential-algebraic equations from
being overly stiff. This promotes model stability and computa-
tional tractability. Using the rapid integration technique described
in Supplement Text S1 (Computational Methodology section), the
model arrives at true and accurate steady state in under one
minute of runtime (,1000 beats are needed, depending on the
CL, Visual C++ running on a desktop PC; more details in
Supplement Text S1). ORd equations are all smoothly varying
functions, free of singularities and ‘‘if’’ conditionals. Thus, the
model can readily be implemented in any of a variety of
automated numerical
integrators, such as Matlab (The Math-
Works Inc.), CellML (http://www.cellml.org/), CHASTE[103],
or CARP (CardioSolv LLC.).

Measurements of undiseased human endo APs were performed
in small tissue preparations (1–3 gram pieces). This was to avoid
possible enzymatic degradation of K
channel proteins[40,42],
affecting currents and the AP. However, electrical loading in tissue
subtly affects behavior[19]. We performed simulations using a
multicellular fiber model to include loading effects, which had only
minor consequences (Figure S8).

measurements are also in this range[58]. Measurements from
Drouin et al. showed longer APDs (,350 ms in endo cells on the
cut transmural face at CL = 1000 ms). Having validated the endo
model based on more than 100 of our own endo AP
measurements, we thought it reasonable to use Drouin transmural
APD ratios, rather than the uniformly longer APDs themselves, for
validation of the transmural cell type models.

The presence of M cell APs in the nonfailing human heart was
observed by Drouin et al.[50], and more recently by Glukhov
et al.[71]. However, there is controversy regarding the M cell
definition and its role in human. Our M cell model was based on
data where the M cell was defined by its transmural location. The
resulting simulated M cell AP corresponded with the ‘‘max cell’’
observed by Glukhov.

Recently, Sarkar and Sobie developed a method for quantitative
analysis of parameter constraint and relationships between
parameters and target outputs in AP models[105]. We did not

Characteristics of Human Tissue

During the last 15 years, undiseased hearts were donated for
research in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and were
approved by the Scientific and Research Ethical Committee of the
Medical Scientific Board of the Hungarian Ministry of Health
(ETT-TUKEB), under
ethical approval No 4991-0/2010-
1018EKU (339/PI/010). Data from 140 hearts were used in this

study. Of these, 78 were from male donors (56%). The average
donor age was 41 years old with standard deviation of 12 years.

Tissue Preparation

Tissue transport and ventricular endo preparations were
performed as previously described[85]. Tissue was carefully
pinned and placed in a modified Tyrodes superfusate (in mM:
NaCl 115, KCl 4, CaCl2 1.8, MgCl2 1, NaHCO3 20, and glucose
11, pH 7.35, 37uC), and point
stimulation was via bipolar
platinum electrodes. Drug solutions were made fresh on the day
of use. Drugs included in this study were, in mM: E-4031 1, HMR-
1556 1, nisoldipine 1, BaCl2 100, ryanodine 5, mexiletine 10.
Simulated application of these drugs was 70% IKr[59], and 90%
IKs[60], ICaL[61], IK1[62], RyR[63], and late INa[64] block,
respectively.

Myocyte Isolation

Tissue transport and myocyte isolation for the undiseased donor
hearts were as previously described[85]. Myocyte isolation
commenced immediately upon arrival
in the laboratory, using
the perfusion disaggregation procedure, previously described[85].

Electrophysiology

Data were obtained using conventional whole cell patch-clamp
techniques. Micropipette fabrication and data acquisition were as
described previously for undiseased donor heart[85]. Axopatch
200 amplifiers, Digidata 1200 converters, and pClamp software
were used (Axon Instruments/Molecular Devices). Experiments
were performed at 37uC.

The standard bath solution contained,

in mM: NaCl 144,
NaH2PO4 0.33, KCl 4.0, CaCl2 1.8, MgCl2 0.53, Glucose 5.5,
and HEPES 5.0 at pH of 7.4, and pipette solutions contained K-
aspartate 100, KCl 25, K2ATP 5, MgCl2 1, EGTA 10 and
HEPES 5. The pH was adjusted to 7.2 by KOH (+15220 mM

).
For L-type Ca2+

current measurement,

the bath solution
contained in mM: tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA-Cl) 157,
MgCl2 0.5, HEPES 10, and 1 mM CaCl2, or BaCl2, or SrCl2
(pH 7.4 with CsOH). The pipette solution contained (in mM)
CsCl 125, TEA-Cl 20, MgATP 5, creatine phosphate 3.6, EGTA
10, and HEPES 10 (pH 7.2 with CsOH).

For Na

exchange current measurement,

and (in mM) ouabain 20, nisoldipine 1, lidocaine 50, pH 7.4. The
pipette solution contained (in mM): CsOH 140, aspartic acid 75,

Ca2+ Transient Florescence

Isolated myocytes from the undiseased donor hearts were used
to measure the Ca2+
transient during point stimulation via bipolar
platinum electrodes, indicated by Fura-2-AM, as was described
previously[106]. Bath temperature was 37uC.

Pacing Protocols

For both experiments and simulations, we determined APD at
30, 50, 70 and 90% of complete repolarization (APD30–90, in
ms). The start of the AP was the time of maximum dVm/dt. The
time of APDX occurred once membrane voltage was X% of the
resting value. Resting voltage was measured immediately prior
to each paced beat. For APD rate dependence, pacing was to
steady state. For APD restitution (S1S2, or static restitution), S1

Undiseased Human Cardiac Action Potential

pacing was at cycle length (CL) = 1000 ms. The S2 beat was
delivered at variable diastolic intervals (DIs), measured relative
to APD90.

The dynamic restitution protocol was simulated as in experi-
ments by Koller et al.[58]. Pacing was at a variety of rates (30
seconds at CLs from 230 to 1000 ms, no S2 beats). APD95 was
plotted against DI (where DI = CL – APD95). Unlike static S1S2
restitution, the dynamic restitution protocol allows for more than
one APD to be associated with a given DI. This is significant
because bifurcation in the dynamic restitution curve is believed to
be arrhythmogenic[107].

Population Based CaMK effects

For all channels affected by CaMK, we created separate
models for the fully CaMK phosphorylated channels, and the
totally non phosphorylated channels. Then, based on the degree
of CaMK activation (CaMKactive), we determined the propor-
tion of channels affected by CaMK. To calculate the CaMK
affected current (or flux), we added the weighted sum of fully
affected and totally unaffected channels, using the proportion-
ality. The model employed for CaMK activity was validated
previously[31,77].

Relative Weights in a Two Time Constant Scheme
When measurements called for a gating process

to be
represented by both a fast and a slow process, we included
separate fast and slow gates. However, we did not simply multiply
fast and slow gates to modulate conductance as others have done
previously. To do so allows the fast process alone to completely
control deactivation/inactivation, and the slow process alone to
completely control activation/recovery. Rather, since measure-
ments of bi-exponential behaviors provide the relative weight of
fast/slow processes, we modeled the measurements accordingly,
and used the weighted sum of fast and slow processes.

Transmural Wedge Simulation

We computed the pseudo-ECG using a 1-dimensional model of
the transmural wedge preparation[108,109]. In brief, the spatially
weighted sum of the voltage gradient was determined at a point
2 cm from the epi end of a heterogeneous multicellular fiber, along
the fiber axis. Cells 1–60 were endo, 61–105 were M, and 106–
165 were epi. The stimulus was delivered to cell 1. Cells 15 from
both ends of
the fiber were excluded from the gradient
measurement due to confounding edge effects. Pacing was for
100 beats using steady state initial conditions from paced single
cells.
