SUMMARY 

AND 

CONCLUSIONS 

1.  We have developed a  19-compartment cable model of  a 
guinea pig CA3 pyramidal neuron. Each compartment is allowed 
to contain six active ionic conductances: gNa, gca, gKcDRJ (where 
DR stands for delayed rectifier), g,,,,  , gktAHP), and gkcc). The con- 
ductance gca is of the high-voltage activated type. The model ki- 
netics for the first five of these conductances incorporate voltage- 
clamp data obtained from isolated hippocampal pyramidal neu- 
rons. The  kinetics of  gKcc) are based on  data  from  bullfrog 
sympathetic neurons. The time constant for  decay of submem- 
brane calcium derives from optical imaging of Ca signals in Pur- 
kinje cell dendrites. 

2.  To construct the model from available voltage-clamp data, 
we first reproduced current-clamp records from a model isolated 
neuron (soma plus proximal dendrites). We next assumed that 
ionic channel kinetics in the dendrites were the same as in the 
soma. In accord with  dendritic recordings and calcium-imaging 
data, we also assumed that significant gca occurs in dendrites. We 
then attached sections of basilar and apical dendritic cable. By trial 
and error, we found a distribution (not necessarily unique) of ionic 
conductance densities that  was consistent with  current-clamp 
records from the soma and dendrites of whole neurons and from 
isolated apical dendrites. 

3.  The resulting model reproduces the Ca2+-dependent spike 
depolarizing afterpotential  (DAP)  recorded after  a  stimulus 
subthreshold for burst elicitation. 

4.  The model also reproduces the behavior of CA3 pyramidal 
neurons injected with  increasing somatic depolarizing currents: 
low-frequency (0.3- 1 .O Hz) rhythmic bursting for small currents, 
with  burst frequency increasing with  current  magnitude; then 
more irregular bursts followed by afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs) 
interspersed with brief bursts without AHPs; and finally, rhythmic 
action potentials without bursts. 

5. The model predicts the existence of still another firing pat- 
tern during tonic depolarizing dendritic stimulation: brief bursts 
at 4 
to -  12 Hz, a pattern not observed during somatic stimula- 
tion.  These bursts correspond to  rhythmic  dendritic  calcium 
spikes. 

6.  The model CA3 pyramidal neuron can be made to resemble 
functionally  a CA1 pyramidal neuron by increasing eKcDR) and 
decreasing dendritic &  and &).  Specifically, after these alter- 
ations, tonic depolarization of the soma leads to adapting repeti- 
tive  firing, whereas stimulation of the distal dendrites leads to 
bursting. 

7. A  critical set of parameters concerns the regulation of the 
pool of intracellular [Ca2’] that interacts with membrane channels 
(8 K(c) and gK(AHP)), particularly in the dendrites. For dendritic cal- 
cium spikes to occur at -  12 Hz, it appears necessary to postulate a 
time constant of ~20 ms for decay of the intracellular [Ca2’] in 
this pool. 

8.  This revised cellular model has been incorporated into a net- 
work of neurons with mutual excitation via-both quisqualate and 
N-methyl-o-aspartate receptor types. Such a model network is 
able to  reproduce picrotoxin-induced  synchronized multiple 
bursts. Repetitive dendritic calcium spikes appear to be crucial for 
the phenomenon of multiple bursts.

METHODS 

Acutely 

isolated  cells 

CA3 pyramidal neurons were isolated from adult guinea pigs 
(weight 200-400g) and whole-cell recordings were obtained by the 
use of methods described by Kay and Wong (1986) and Numann 
et al. (1987). 

Structure  of model  and  electrotonic  parameters 

The structure of the compartmental model is illustrated at the 
bottom of Fig. 1. It  is the same structure as before (Traub 1982) 
except that dendritic branching is omitted. The basilar (left) and 
apical (right) dendrites are each represented by an equivalent cylin- 
der (Rall 1962a). This is a reasonable description in view of the 
approximate 3/2 power branching of hippocampal pyramidal cell 
dendrites (Turner and Schwartzkroin 1980). As before, we do not 
consider the  nonuniform  electrotonic length of  different den- 
drites. Each dendritic compartment represents 0.1 X of membrane, 
and there are 19 compartments in all (8 for the basilar dendrites, 1 
for the soma, and 10 for the apical dendrites). The parameters that 
define the structure and electrotonic properties of the model are as 
follows: Ri  =  100 Q-cm, R,  =  10,000 Q-cm2, Cm =  3 pF/cm2 
(Turner and Schwartzkroin 1980), 7M =  30 ms, input resistance 
apical dendrite = 60 MQ,  input resistance basilar dendrite = 90 
MQ, and input resistance of the whole cell = 32 Ma.  The whole- 
cell input resistance is in the observed range (at least as recorded 
with sharp electrodes); Turner and Schwartzkroin ( 1983) obtained 
an average input  resistance of  33 R/IQ for CA3  pyramidal cells. 
Horseradish peroxidase injections of CA3  cells combined with 
electrical measurements led to  an estimate of  ~67  MQ  for the

The soma dimensions were radius 4.23 pm, length 125 pm, area 
3,320 pm2. Although the shape of the soma is not realistic (it is too 
long and narrow), its area is reasonable. For example, if the soma 
were approximated by  a cone of  basal radius 12.5 pm (r)  and 
height 75 pm (h), the area would be arfm 
+ rr2 = 3,477 pm2. 
The dimensions of an apical compartment were radius 2.89 
pm, length 120 pm (hence 1 X = 1,200 pm = 0.12 cm), area 2,188 
pm’*  Because 
= 0.120 cm, these numbers are consistent with each other.

The dimensions of a basilar compartment were radius 2.42 pm, 
length 110 pm, area = 1,673 pm2. The reader should recall that the 
equivalent cylinder  corresponding to  a branching dendrite is 
longer than the original dendrite (Rall 1962b), so that distances 
along the equivalent cylinder do  not  directly  match distances 
alongside the actual neuron. A coordinate transformation must be 
applied for the match. 

Simulations were run not only in the entire structure shown in 
Fig.  1, but also in pieces of it.  We simulated an acutely isolated 
neuron as a soma with an adjacent basilar and apical dendritic 
compartment. Isolated apical and dendritic cables were simulated, 
as were neurons with the apical and/or basilar cylinders truncated. 
In all such cases, the ends of the dendritic cylinders were sealed. 
We did not correct for the apparent increase in membrane resistiv- 
ity that occurs in isolated cells (Kay and Wong 1986; Storm 1990). 

Physics  of the  model 

Voltage excursions in a cable model, in general, are described by 
the cable equation (Rall 1989). For a compartmental model, we of

course  use a version  of the  cable equation  that  is discrete  in  space 
and  continuous 
in  time.  First,  let  us  outline  our  system  of  units 
and our  notation.  We  use a consistent  set of units:  mV,  nA,  ms,  nF, 
relative  to resting  poten- 
and pS. Membrane  potentials  are written 
tial.  The  extracellular  space  is  assumed  to  be isopotential. 
In  our 
notation,  the second  subscript  (k  or  i) is used to index  the compart- 
ment  number  (Fig.  1, bottom).  The letter C is used for a capaci- 
tance. Subscript L  refers to the leakage conductance or current; 
and Na, Ca, and K refer to the respective ions. &a)  I?&, and & 
are constants that represent the respective equilibrium potentials. 
The bar superscript, as in &,  denotes the maximum ionic con- 
ductance of a particular type in  a particular compartment; the 
actual conductance at a given time will  be the product  of the 
(constant) g term with  appropriate voltage- and/or calcium-de- 
pendent dimensionless variables. The subscripts K(DR),  K(A), 
K(AHP),  and K(C)  refer to the four  types of K  currents in the 
model: DR stands for delayed rectifier, A  for the A-type  of tran- 
sient current,  AHP  for  the  long-duration Ca-dependent AHP 
current (Hotson and Prince 1980; Lancaster and Adams 1986; 
Lancaster and Nicoll  1987; Numann et al. 1987), and C for the 
short-duration Ca- and voltage-dependent current (Adams et al. 
1982; Alger and Williamson 1988; Lancaster and Nicoll  1987). 
The letters m,  h, s, r, ~1, a,  b,  4, and c denote dimensionless mem- 
brane-state variables that control the various ionic conductances; 
their values lie between 0 and 1. x is the calcium concentration in 
a “shell” beneath the membrane. This shell can be considered as a 
cytoplasmic compartment attached to the inside of each mem- 
brane compartment. x grows by transmembrane influx  of Ca (in- 
tracellular Ca release not being considered) and declines by first- 
order decay with time constant &-‘.  x  in turn regulates the local 
AHP  and C conductances. Radial and axial diffusion of calcium 
are not simulated in the model, nor are cytoplasmic uptake and 
buffering of calcium explicitly simulated. Many  of these terms are 
recapitulated in the equations below and in the Glossary 
TRODUCTION).

The above equation describes the relation of specific membrane- 
state variables and submembrane Ca to ionic conductances. 

The synaptic currents that we shall consider in this paper are 
excitatory only and occur onto two compartments: numbers 3 and 
15, each 0.6X from the soma in the basilar or apical direction, 
respectively (the compartment numbering is indicated in Fig. 1). 
A presynaptic action potential induces a fast excitatory postsynap- 
tic potential (EPSP) in compartments 3 and 15 (corresponding to 
QUIS receptor activation) and a slow voltage-dependent EPSP in 
compartment 15 (corresponding to NMDA  receptor activation). 
The QUIS synaptic current in each compartment is cQuIstPi2 
X 
(V -  60), where V is the local membrane potential and 60 mV is 
the EPSP reversal potential relative to rest. The 2-ms time con- 
stant is consistent with the voltage-clamp data of Brown and John- 
ston (1983) on the mossy fiber EPSP; this QUIS component may 
correspond to the rapidly inactivating quisqualate-activated con- 

ductance reported by Tang et al. (1989) in cultured hippocampal 
neurons. The NMDA  EPSP is more complicated (Nowak et al. 
1984). A presynaptic action potential induces a ligand-gated “vir- 
tual  conductance,” g(t), which peaks at 2 ms in the model an 
decays with  time constant of  lOO- 150 ms (Forsythe and West- 
brook 1988). Both the onset and decay kinetics that we used may 
be, if anything, too rapid (Lester et al. 1990). The actual synaptic 
conductance is the virtual conductance (ligand-dependent) times 
a voltage- and magnesium-dependent Boltzmann term. The form 
of the Boltzmann term that we use is similar to that reported by 
Jahr and Stevens (1990). The model NMDA  current is thus

where 2: is either 50 or 60 mV. We take [Mg2’]  to be 2 mM,  the 
external concentration often used in hippocampal slice experi- 
ments. The current-voltage relation of the NMDA  current so simu- 
lated has the characteristic negative dip at potentials between rest 
and the EPSP equilibrium potential (Nowak et al. 1984), in the 
present case being a minimum at 40.5 mV positive to rest when 
4‘ = 60 mV. QUIS postsynaptic conductances onto a given neuron 
that are caused by multiple presynaptic action potentials (arriving 
at the same time as each other, or at different times) add linearly. 
Likewise, NMDA  postsynaptic conductances onto a given neu- 
ron, caused by  multiple presynaptic action potentials, add lin- 
early. In each cell, the total NMDA  conductance saturates: it is not 
allowed to exceed a predetermined maximum value. 

The equation for intracellular [Ca2’] in compartment i, xi,  is as 

follows

where @i is a scaling constant (defined in the Glossary  at the end of 
the INTRODUCTION), 
and p, = 0.075 = l/13.33 ms-‘. Such a rapid 
time constant ( 13.33 ms) for decay of intracellular Ca is consistent 
with  the time constants determined for the decay of optical Ca 
signals in fine Purkinje cell dendrites: ~20  ms (W. N. Ross, per- 
sonal communication) or even less than this (Sugimori and Llinas 
1990). A  negative value for -Ica,i in Eq. 3 corresponds to inward 
current. 

We did not attempt to include all of the ionic currents that have 
been described in hippocampal neurons. For example, we did not 
include the M  type of K current (Halliwell and Adams 1982), the 
so-called anomalous inward rectifier  (Hotson et al.  1979), the 
slowly inactivating 1k reported by Storm (1988), or the persistent 
Na current reported by French et al. ( 1990). It is not possible for us 
to be certain of the consequences of these omissions until a new 
model is developed that includes these currents. All we can say is 
that  certain cellular firing properties can be reproduced with  a 
limited repertoire of currents. 

Kinetics  of the  active  channels 

The general formalism derives from the Hodgkin-Huxley equa- 
tions. Thus, if xk is a membrane state variable for compartment k, 
and fik is either vk or Xk (depending on &),  then

Note that the rate functions cy, and P, do not themselves depend 
on  k  in  our  model; that  is, we need not write  a,& or &k.  To 
emphasize: we assume that  the  kinetics of  voltage-dependent 
membrane channels are the same in the dendrites as in the soma. 
This is an assumption of the model made for the sake of simplicity 
and because of the lack of kinetic data on dendritic ionic channels.

The reader will recall the steady-state value of x, X,  = ar.J(c~, + &) 
and the time constant for relaxation to X,  ,T,  =  1/(0r, + &).  Thus, 
if X,  and 7, are known as functions of voltage, then the rate func- 
tions cy, and &  can be reconstructed. 

The rate functions that we use are shown in Tables 1 and 2. 
Some justification and comments on these rate functions now 
follow. 

I)  gNa*  Our m,  and h,  are similar to the steady-state “activa- 
tion”  and “inactivation”  variables plotted by  Sah et al. (1988a), 
allowing for the fact that h(v)  shifts to the right on the voltage axis 
at higher temperature (Sah et al. performed their experiments on 
isolated cells at 22°C  whereas most slice experiments are per- 
formed at 232°C). The rate functions for m and h were scaled so 
that dV/dt  during an action potential was 2 100 V/s with &a = 30 
mS/cm2 on the soma. 

2) gca. a, and & are taken directly from Kay and Wong (1987) 
(our activation variable s is called “m”  in that paper; we have also 
corrected printing errors in the equations of Kay and Wong). Our 
model resting potential, called “0 mV”  in our mathematical nota- 
tion, is assumed to correspond to -60  mV. Note that this calcium 
current is of  the high-voltage-activated type.  Although  we are 
aware of data suggesting the existence of multiple types of calcium 
channels in CA3 cells (Fisher et al. 1990), the high-voltage-acti- 
vated type is both the best characterized and is sufficient to ac- 
count for depolarizing afterpotentials (DAP) and for bursting. The 
second power of the activation variable (s2) is also taken from Kay 
and Wong (1987). The inactivation  of gca is complicated (Kay 
199 l),  having fast and slow voltage-dependent phases and a cal- 
cium-dependent component as well. Because the slow voltage-de- 
pendent inactivation process and the calcium-dependent inactiva- 
tion process take so long (7 of hundreds of milliseconds or more), 
we have omitted these processes. We approximate the fast inacti- 
vation with kinetics such that Y,  =  1 at potentials hyperpolarized 
to rest and such that roe is proportional to e-V20 for vabove resting 
potential.

n,  and 7, are close to those reported by  Sah et al. 
(1988b), except that 7, has been shifted to the right on the voltage 
axis by -  15 mV, in accord with data obtained from isolated CA3 
cells (Numann et al.  1987) [the data of Sah et al. (1988b) were 
from isolated CA1 cells]. The use of the first power of n, rather 
than the usual higher powers, is also taken from Sah et al. (1988b). 
We did not include inactivation of this current. By using a higher 
power of n, it  was possible to obtain narrower and larger action 
potentials than occur in the model as presented. We nevertheless 
chose to adhere to the formalism published by Sah et al. (1988b). 
a,  and b,  are consistent with the data of Numann et al. 
(1987, Fig. 4). The rate functions were scaled to be consistent with 
the few points given by these authors for 7, and the point for 7b (25 
ms at - 10 mV absolute potential). 

4)&(A)*

l  The forward rate function is calcium dependent but 
not voltage dependent (Lancaster and Adams 1986). It is scaled so 
that after a burst the peak AHP  conductance is delayed for lOO- 
200 ms (Lancaster and Adams 1986). The backward rate function, 
l/l,000  ms-‘, is somewhat faster than the l/2,000 ms-’ reported 
by Numann et al. (1987), allowing for the temperature difference. 
gK(C)*  We could not find sufficient data from hippocampal 
neurons to characterize the kinetics of this current, although it is 
known to  be present in hippocampal neurons (Numann et al. 
1987; Storm  1987). We therefore used data from Adams et al. 
(1982) from bullfrog sympathetic neurons. The conductance is 
increased by intracellular calcium. We assumed the conductance 
was proportional to a voltage-dependent term times a saturating 
calcium-dependent term. [This formalism is different from that of 
Yamada et al. (1989), who made the forward rate function depen- 
dent on both Vand calcium]. A linear dependence of equilibrium 
gK(C) on intracellular calcium is consistent with data from ApZysia 
neurons, although in the latter case a dependence of channel ki- 
netics on  calcium  seems likely  (Zucker  1989). Furthermore, 
Zucker (1989) did not observe a saturation of the K  current for 
intracellular calcium concentrations up to  20 PM,  but this was 
under conditions in which calcium was released from an intracel- 
lular chelator by flash photolysis, rather than under physiological 
conditions. Adams et al. (1982) noted that 7, increased e-fold for 
27 mV of depolarization, that c,  increased e-fold for  11 mV of 
depolarization, and that c,  saturates abruptly (at a potential we 
take as 50 mV positive to rest). Our kinetics are the simplest that 
we could construct that are consistent with these data. The rate 
functions were scaled so that 7, was fast enough for the conduc- 
tance to be partially activated during a single action potential (7, = 
3.62 ms at 60 mV relative to rest). We did not include inactivation 
of this current.

Ionic  conductance  densities 

TRAUB  ET  AL. 

This study proceeded in two phases. First was a general explora- 
tion of the effects of different soma-dendritic distributions of ionic 
conductance densities, together with some fine-tuning of the rate 
functions and the &  (i.e., the coupling of &a to intracellular Ca 
concentration). We  shall not describe this exploration in  great 
detail, but rather present two particular sets of conductance densi- 
ties, for CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells, respectively (Tables 3 and 
4; Figs. 1 and 2). The second phase was a detailed examination of 
the properties of the CA3 and CA 1 models with fixed parameters. 
These properties will be presented in RESULTS. 

Figure 3 shows the current-voltage relations for  three of the 
model compartments. These curves reflect both the voltage- and 
calcium-dependent kinetics and the conductance densities. It  is 
customary to present current-voltage relations in the steady state, 
when all of the membrane state variables have assumed their equi- 
librium  values. For  understanding bursting, however, we have 
found it more useful to use a pseudo-steady state in which all of 
the membrane state variables are in equilibrium except for one of 
the slowest ones, r (representing gca inactivation); Y is assumed to 
be 1. The reason for doing this is as follows. The current-voltage 
relation provides physical insight if  one can approximate the 
membrane dynamics at a particular membrane voltage as an ap- 
proach to  the steady-state characteristic of  that  voltage, even 
though membrane currents keep changing the membrane voltage. 
In the “true”  steady state of the model, gca is largely inactivated at 
depolarized membrane potentials. Thus the steady-state approxi- 
mation is not appropriate for the understanding of bursting, which 
critically depends on the occurrence of calcium-dependent action 
potentials taking place from a state without gca inactivation.  On 
the other hand, a typical burst of action potentials itself leads to 
negligible gca inactivation, because the time constant of gca inacti- 
vation is long relative to the depolarized part of a burst. The ap- 
proximation r = 1 is therefore appropriate in this context. (Were a 
low-threshold Ca current to be included in  the model, this ap- 
proach would become more complicated.) We plot the current- 
voltage relation at a number of different “clamped” values of x, 
the intracellular Ca concentration. These different x values deter- 
mine the extent to which gKccj and gKcAHP) are activated. The cusps 
that occur in some of the curves at 50 mV positive to rest reflect the 
postulated sudden saturation of g,,,,  at this potential.

Numerical  methods.  The  differential  equations  were  integrated  using  a 
2nd-order  Taylor  series method  (Daniel  and  Moore  1970; Traub  and  Miles 
199 lb)  with  a fixed  time  step of 50  ps. Programs  were  written 
in  FOR- 
TRAN  and  run  on  an IBM  3090  computer.  For  making  figures, data were 
stored  every 0.25  ms of a simulation. 

Several features of the current-voltage relations are worthy  of 
note. The soma has a “well”  of inward current at 25 mV positive to 
rest, as a result of gNa. The relatively small gca appears as an inflec- 
tion  on the current-voltage curve at 60 mV when x  is small. In 
contrast, at 0.3X from the soma, there are two distinct wells, one 
for gNa and one for gca, with  the latter disappearing as x  is in- 
creased. We remind the reader that gca inactivation was not in- 
cluded in this figure, so that disappearance of the gca well with 
increasing x  is caused by activation of g,,,.  One expects that Na

2) &a*  The density of gca was estimated by  Kay  and Wong 
to be -7  mS/cm2 in isolated CA 1 cells. We have kept gca 
(1987) 
density near to this value on and next to the soma, the average 
density on the soma and adjacent compartments being 6.15 mS/ 
cm2. If this density is too large at the soma, action potentials be- 
come too broad or do not repolarize. At  the same time, there must 
be sufficient gca on and near the soma so that burstlike events 
(usually without slow Ca-mediated action potentials) can occur in 
isolated cells as illustrated in Fig. 4. In the model, gca is critical for 
generation of the depolarizing envelope of such bursts. Intraden- 
dritic recordings from isolated dendrites (Masukawa and Prince 
1984) and from whole cells (Poolos et al. 1990; Wong et al. 1979; 
Michelson and Wong, unpublished data) indicate that  calcium 
spikes and bursts can be generated in the dendrites independent of 
the soma. This is the case in both CA1 and CA3 cells. Calcium 
spikes may be as large as 65 mV and are larger in the middle 
dendrites than in the soma (Wong et al. 1979). Calcium-imaging

spikes would occur readily at this dendritic location but that Ca 
spikes would occur only in a “resting” condition of low intracellu- 
lar Ca. Finally,  at 0.6X from the soma, gNa is absent. There is a 
large &a well corresponding to the high gca density; this well per- 
sists until x >  150, reflecting the absence of gK(DR) in this region of 
the model membrane. One expects, therefore, that repetitive Ca 
spikes might be generated here, provided that membrane potential 
can be held depolarized enough and that at the same time the cell 
is not too overloaded with Ca. A rapid time constant for removal 
of intracellular calcium (i.e., a large value of &)  favors the occur- 
rence of repetitive calcium spikes. 

Some of  the justification  for  the conductance densities is as 

follows. These comments apply to our CA3 model. 

I) gNa. The data of Sah et al. (1988a) indicate that the density of 
this conductance in an isolated cell can be as high as 40 mS/cm2. 
For both CA3 and CA 1 models, we use a density of 30 mS/cm2 on 
the soma and a somewhat smaller density on the adjacent mem- 
brane. Because the apical dendrites in CA1 and CA3 cells (Masu- 
kawa and Prince 1984; Wong et al. 1979) can generate Na spikes, 
as can CA 1 basilar dendrites (Lacaille et al. 1987), we have a com-

experiments likewise indicate the existence of voltage-dependent 
gca channels in basilar and apical dendrites (Regehr et al. 1989), 
although perhaps not in  the most extreme distal dendrites. We 
have therefore placed sufficient gca in both sets of dendrites so that 
large calcium spikes can be locally generated (see later). By modify- 
ing the amount of dendritic gca together with somatic gK(pRJ, we 
can regulate how the cell responds to somatic injection of current: 
either with bursting or with trains of action potentials. 

Although several outward currents may contribute to 
repolarization of the action potential (Storm 1987), &@R) should 
be sufficient to repolarize the action potential unassisted at least in 
an isolated CA1 cell (Sah et al. 1988b). We chose to follow Sah et 
al. (1988b) in this respect. If gk(PR) density is too small, the action 
potential becomes too broad or does not repolarize at all; if the 
density is too large, the action potential is too small or there is a 
large immediate AHP  (although this latter might be masked by 
I&.  Because the model contains regions of dendritic gNa, gk(DR) 
must be located in the dendrites to repolarize dendritic Na action 
potentials. On the other hand, significant &@R) in the more distal 
dendrites would suppress the generation of Ca spikes. This in turn 
meant that gKccJ was the main outward current for repolarization 
of calcium spikes. This current was especially important because 
the voltage-dependent inactivation of Ica is slow.

l  The density of this conductance approximately fol- 
lowed that of gca to ensure repolarization of Ca spikes. The relative 
density of the two conductances was reflected in the width of the 
calcium spikes. Inclusion of additional dendritic K currents (e.g., 
M  current, A  current) might have altered the requisite balance 
between gca and gKtc). 

l  A  constant density was used (except where gca was 
absent) sufficient that a post-burst AHP was in the range 5- 10 mV. 
@  gK(A)  was located only at the soma, an assumption that may 
not be accurate. The density was sufficient to produce a character- 
istic lag in the response to a depolarizing current after the cell had 
been hyperpolarized  for  several hundred  milliseconds (not 
shown). Although this current produced some effects on repetitive 
bursting (some prolongation of the interburst interval), its contri- 
bution to the model behavior appeared to be rather subtle. By 
“titrating”  the density of &(A)) we noted that increasing this den- 
sity led to a delay in onset of a current-evoked action potential, as 
well as to a smaller amplitude of the action potential. This implies 
that the current was activated on the upstroke of the action poten- 
tial.  Perhaps if  we had used somewhat slower kinetics for  this 
conductance, it  might instead have made more contribution  to 
action-potential repolarization.

on  CA3  cell  bursts  were  these:  a burst  could  sometimes  be

Deferent  Ca  dynamics 

in  the  soma  and  dendrites 

Assuming that  C-current kinetics are the same in  soma and 
dendrites, we then found it necessary to delay the coupling of Ca 
entry to C-current activation in the dendrites. This was necessary 
for the occurrence of large dendritic calcium spikes. Our finding 
may be an artifact of the C-conductance formalism that we use in 
that intracellular calcium is always in equilibrium with the con- 
ductance (because the  conductance is proportional to  x).  We 
make the assumption that the dendritic shell in which calcium 
interacts with K  channels is larger (by a factor of 4.44) than the 
corresponding shell for the soma and immediately adjacent com- 
partments. The relevant parameter in the model is called 4i (see 
the Glossary and Eq. 3). Thus more calcium entry must occur in 
the dendrites compared with the somatic region to raise x by the 
same extent. This assumption is equivalent formally to assuming 
stronger buffering of calcium in the dendrites than in the soma. 
The approach of  Yamada et  al. (1989) is an alternative one, 
whereby calcium is not  in equilibrium with  the C-channel but 
rather influences the kinetics of channel opening.
