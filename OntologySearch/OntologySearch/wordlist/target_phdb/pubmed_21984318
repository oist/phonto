Abstract Deep brain stimulation (DBS) and lesioning are
two surgical techniques used in the treatment of advanced
Parkinson’s disease (PD) in patients whose symptoms are
not well controlled by drugs, or who experience dyskinesias
as a side effect of medications. Although these treatments
have been widely practiced, the mechanisms behind DBS
and lesioning are still not well understood. The subthalamic
nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus pars interna (GPi) are
two common targets for both DBS and lesioning. Previous
studies have indicated that DBS not only affects local cells
within the target, but also passing axons within neighboring
regions. Using a computational model of the basal ganglia-
thalamic network, we studied the relative contributions of
activation and silencing of local cells (LCs) and fibers of
passage (FOPs) to changes in the accuracy of information
transmission through the thalamus (thalamic fidelity),
which is correlated with the effectiveness of DBS.
Activation of both LCs and FOPs during STN and GPi-
DBS were beneficial to the outcome of stimulation. During

STN and GPi lesioning, effects of silencing LCs and FOPs
were different between the two types of lesioning. For STN
lesioning, silencing GPi FOPs mainly contributed to its
effectiveness, while silencing only STN LCs did not
improve thalamic fidelity. In contrast, silencing both GPi
LCs and GPe FOPs during GPi lesioning contributed to
improvements in thalamic fidelity. Thus,
two distinct
mechanisms produced comparable improvements in tha-
lamic function: driving the output of the basal ganglia to
produce tonic inhibition and silencing the output of the
basal ganglia to produce tonic disinhibition. These results
show the importance of considering effects of activating or
silencing fibers passing close to the nucleus when deciding
upon a target location for DBS or lesioning.

1 Introduction

Surgical treatments, including deep brain stimulation (DBS)
and lesioning, are used to treat symptoms in patients with
advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD) who are less responsive to
pharmacological treatments or suffer from disabling dyskine-
sias. Clinicians have targeted both the subthalamic nucleus
(STN) and globus pallidus interna (GPi) for DBS in PD, and
clinical results indicate that both targets are effective at
reducing dyskinesias and motor symptoms including tremor,
bradykinesia, and rigidity (Weaver et al. 2009; Moro et al.
2010). However, several aspects of DBS remain to be

optimized, largely due to the lack of understanding of the
mechanisms of action. For example, DBS is not equally
effective for all patients, and some symptoms may respond
better to DBS than other symptoms (St George et al. 2010).
Furthermore,
the choice of parameters for stimulation
remains largely empirical, and the process of device tuning
is time consuming and tedious, presenting a burden for
clinicians, and causing discomfort and frustration for patients
(Kuncel and Grill 2004). Lesioning of the STN or GPi is an
alternative when DBS is not available or feasible (Okun and
Vitek 2004). Although lesioning may be as effective as DBS
(Gross 2008), side effects remain a major concern. Lesioning
of the STN is still not considered safe because of persistent
hemiballism that occurs in a high percentage of patients who
undergo the procedure (Alvarez et al. 2009; Tarsy 2009), and
lesions are usually restricted to only one side as bilateral
pallidotomy is associated with adverse effects on gait,
speech, and cognition (Gross 2008).

To understand the mechanisms underlying these two
surgical treatments, knowledge of changes in neural activity
during DBS and after lesioning is required. The develop-
ment of PD is associated with complex changes in neuronal
firing rates and patterns within the basal ganglia, including
increases in bursting and oscillatory behavior (Levy et al.
2000; Magnin et al. 2000; Benazzouz et al. 2002; Levy et
al. 2002). It was surmised early on that DBS created a
virtual lesion by depolarization blockade of neural activity,
but several lines of evidence now support that activation of
the target nucleus is responsible for the alleviation of
symptoms during DBS (Hashimoto et al. 2003; Grill et al.
2004; McIntyre et al. 2004; Rubin and Terman 2004;
Garcia et al. 2005; Montgomery 2005; Xu et al. 2008;
Dorval et al. 2009; Dorval et al. 2010). The regularization
of firing patterns within the basal ganglia during DBS could
eliminate pathological activity and thereby normalize basal
ganglia function (McIntyre and Hahn 2009). Similarly,
lesioning of the STN or GPi
to eliminate
pathological output from the basal ganglia to the thalamus.
Recent studies calculated the spatial extent of neural
activation generated by DBS in the STN and GPi.
Miocinovic et al.
(2006) and Johnson and McIntyre
(2008) used computational modeling to show that stimula-
tion not only activates local cells (LCs) in the target
nucleus, but also fibers of passage (FOPs) that project to
other nuclei but pass close to the target. Thus, stimulation at
one target site can have effects on multiple anatomical
locations. Using three-dimensional anatomical reconstruc-
tions, they determined the distributions of LCs and FOPs
that were activated during DBS under various stimulation
conditions. However, the impact of the relative proportions
of activation of different neuronal populations (e.g., LCs in
STN versus GPi FOPs) on the thalamus and the subsequent
link to therapeutic benefits of DBS are still unclear.

is thought

The objective of the present study was to quantify the
relative contributions of changes in LC and FOP activity to
the accuracy of thalamic transmission during both DBS and
lesioning. We implemented a computational model of a
basal ganglia-thalamic network (BG model) by modifying
and validating the model developed by Rubin and Terman
(2004), and used the modified model to study the effect of
neural activation or silencing on the relay of information
through the thalamus. Thalamic relay fidelity is correlated
with the efficacy of symptom alleviation in an animal
model of PD (Guo et al. 2008) as well as the degree of
bradykinesia in persons with PD (Dorval et al. 2010), and
thereby serves as a valid proxy for treatment effectiveness.

2 Methods

2.1 Model of the basal Ganglia-Thalamic network
(BG model)

The model used in our simulations was modified from the
basal ganglia-thalamic network model developed by Rubin
and Terman (RT model) (Terman et al. 2002; Rubin and
Terman 2004). The BG model was comprised of thalamic
(TH), subthalamic nucleus (STN), and globus pallidus pars
externa and interna (GPe and GPi) neurons, interconnected
to form a network which responds to input from the
sensorimotor cortex (SMC) (Fig. 1(a)). We expanded the
original model from 16 cells to 100 cells in each population
of TH, STN, GPe and GPi neurons in the BG model to
allow fine-grained modulation of the proportion of individ-
ual neurons activated or lesioned. While the use of a
smaller number of neurons in each population (10) resulted
in the same trends described for the results with 100
neurons, it did not enable fine modulation of the proportion
of neurons activated or silenced. All equations for the
model and comparisons to the original RT model are
provided in Appendix A.

Models for the individual STN, GPe, GPi and TH
neurons in the BG model were similar to those used in the
RT model, but changes were made to match more closely
experimental data on neuron firing properties. The dynam-
ics of
the calcium currents and afterhyperpolarization
currents in the STN model neuron were modified to match
those described in Wilson et al. (2004). The afterhyperpo-
larization current in the GP model was altered to enhance
accommodation seen in GP cells (Weaver et al. 2009; Moro
et al. 2010). The reversal potential of the leak current of GP
cells was made less polarized to prevent spontaneous firing
in the absence of any applied current (Nambu and Llinas
1994). Finally, the dynamics of the calcium current were
slowed and the reversal potential of the potassium current
was made less hyperpolarized in the TH model to reduce

cell responding to stimulus pulses from the sensorimotor cortex. Some

oscillations in membrane voltage and decrease the depth of
the afterhyperpolarization.

Neurons in the BG model were connected in a sparse but
structured manner (Fig. 1(b)), similar to the RT model.
Modifications were made such that there were an equal
number of projections from the STN to the GPe and GPi.
Each STN cell had excitatory projections to two GPe and
two GPi neurons; and each GPe cell had inhibitory
projections to two STN, two GPi and two GPe neurons.
These projections were chosen in accordance with the
topographical organization and the convergence and diver-
gence of synaptic connectivity within the basal ganglia
(Smith et al. 1998). Each GPi neuron made one inhibitory
projection to a single thalamic neuron. Parent et al. (2001)
identified multiple branches and axon terminals from the
GPi within the thalamic nucleus, with single GPi axons
forming collaterals on various thalamic cells, suggesting
that each GPi axon projected to a single functional thalamic
unit comprised of multiple thalamic cells.
Synaptic currents were modeled using the equation
lsyn ¼ gsynS n   Esyn
. For STN and GPi efferents, the first
order model of the synapse used in the RT model was

 



replaced by a second order alpha synapse to enable additive
synaptic effects when DBS was applied. For all other
synaptic connections, the original synapse in the RT model
was retained, where S followed a first order differential
equation.

The SMC input was modeled as a series of monophasic
current pulses with an amplitude of 3.5 uA/cm2 and a
duration of 5 ms. The instantaneous frequencies of
incoming pulses were drawn from a gamma distribution
with an average rate of 14 Hz and a coefficient of variation
of 0.2. We included variance in the SMC input to simulate
the non-regular nature of incoming signals from the cortex
to the thalamus. Positive constant bias currents (Iapp), which
can be viewed as the net synaptic input to these cells from
other brain regions, were applied to the STN, GPe and GPi
neurons to maintain baseline firing rates of 70 Hz and
80 Hz for GPe and GPi (Boraud et al. 1998), and 10 Hz for
STN (Steigerwald et al. 2008). The applied currents in the
BG model were mostly higher than in the RT model to
match physiological recordings more closely. Finally, as in
the RT model, monophasic DBS pulses were applied
intracellularly to STN, GPi or GPe neurons with an

502

J Comput Neurosci (2012) 32:499–519

amplitude of 300 uA/cm2 and a pulse width of 0.3 ms to
evoke one action potential with every pulse that was
applied.

The switch from healthy condition to Parkinsonian
condition in the BG model was achieved by decreasing
the constant bias currents Iapp applied to the STN, GPe and
GPi. The result was an increase in bursting behavior and
synchronization of the GPe and GPi neurons, similar to the
original RT model, and consistent with what is observed in
humans with PD (Levy et al. 2000; Magnin et al. 2000;
Brown et al. 2001; Benazzouz et al. 2002; Levy et al.
2002), as well as in dopamine-depleted rodents (Hassini et
al. 1996; Beurrier et al. 1999; Costa et al. 2006; Wilson et
al. 2006) and monkeys (Bergman et al. 1994; Wichmann et
al. 1994; Bergman et al. 1998). Further, these alterations
were consistent with recent modeling results illustrating
that firing patterns in PD result from changes in the inputs
to the basal ganglia (Hahn and McIntyre 2010). All
simulations with DBS and lesioning in the present study
were conducted in the Parkinsonian condition.

Simulations were implemented in Matlab 7.4.0 (The
MathWorks, Natick, MA) with equations solved using the
forward Euler method with a time step of 0.01 ms.

2.2 Model assessment

The performance of the BG network was quantified by
measuring how accurately the TH neurons relayed inputs
from the SMC. The error index (EI), as described by Rubin
and Terman (2004), is a quantitative measure of the fidelity
of thalamic throughput. The network achieves optimum
performance when each input pulse from the SMC results
in a single action potential
in each thalamic neuron,
detected as transmembrane voltage crossing a threshold of
−40 mV. EI is defined as the total number of errors divided
by the total number of input stimuli.

Three types of errors in thalamic transmission were
considered (Fig. 1(c)): misses, bursts and spurious events.
A miss occurred when a neuron failed to spike, a burst
occurred when a neuron spiked more than once within
25 ms of a stimulating input, and a spurious event occurred
if the thalamic cell fired in the absence of a stimulating
input. For each condition tested, the EIs were averaged
across 20 ten-second simulations with a unique pattern of
SMC input delivered during each simulation.

2.3 Profiles of activation or lesioning

The STN and GPi are both targets of DBS or lesioning for
relieving the symptoms of PD. Although the electrode is
placed within the STN or GPi during DBS, activation could
extend beyond local cells (LCs) within the nucleus to fibers
of passage (FOPs) nearby. Similarly, lesioning of a target

nucleus could result in lesioning of neighboring FOPs. The
activation or lesioning profiles specify the proportions of
LC and FOP activated or silenced during DBS or lesion,
respectively.

Miocinovic et al. analyzed STN DBS using experimental
data from two monkeys and a three-dimensional anatomical
model of the basal ganglia to calculate the proportion of
activation of STN LCs and GPi FOPs during behaviorally
ineffective and effective stimulation (Miocinovic et al.
2006). Similarly, Johnson et al. quantified activation of
GPi LCs and GPe FOPs passing near and through the GPi
during GPi DBS (Johnson and McIntyre 2008). We
implemented these activation profiles in the BG model by
applying DBS to only select groups of neurons, mimicking
the proportions of LC and FOP that were activated in the
two studies. For a given level of activation, the specific
cells that were stimulated were randomly selected from
each population of 100 neurons.

In addition, we expanded the range of activation profiles
to include all permutations of the proportions of LC and
FOP activated for both STN and GPi DBS (from 0 to
100%, in 2% increments). Similarly, lesioning profiles were
implemented by silencing various proportions of LCs and
FOPs to simulate lesion of the STN and GPi. The two
factors potentially affecting the thalamic output—the total
proportion activated or silenced and the LC:FOP activation/
silencing ratio—were analyzed.

3 Model validation

To validate the properties of the BG model, we first
compared the behavior of each individual type of neuron
with published frequency-intensity (f–i) curves, as well
as patterns of firing under different stimulation condi-
tions. Subsequently, we compared firing rates of
the
interconnected neurons in the network to experimental
data, and finally, compared the effects of DBS frequency
on thalamic fidelity to published results of the effects of
DBS frequency on symptoms.

3.1 Single cell validation

3.1.1 Thalamic neuron

The TH cell does not fire spontaneously, but its firing rate
increases with increased constant current injections during
experimental studies (Fig. 2(a)). The f–i curve of the model
thalamic cell exhibited a similar trend with a decrease in
slope with increased current amplitude, although the same
magnitude of applied current generally resulted in higher
firing rates in the model
thalamic cells than in the
experimental data.

including (a) rebound bursting after release from hyperpolarization,
(b) subthreshold capacitive charging and discharging, and (c) train of
action potentials with suprathreshold current injection

The thalamic cell exhibits some unique electrophys-
iological characteristics due to the presence of T-type
calcium currents, and these were reproduced by the
model
thalamic neuron (Fig. 2(b)). A depolarizing
current applied at an intermediate resting potential
produced subthreshold charging and discharging of the
cell membrane. The same current applied at a hyper-
polarized rest potential led to a burst of action potentials.
Finally, when the same depolarizing pulse was applied at a
depolarized resting potential, a train of action potentials
was generated.

3.1.2 STN neuron

STN neurons fire at low rates in the absence of applied
current (Bevan and Wilson 1999) and have a sigmoidal f–i
curve, with a secondary range that has a greater slope than
the primary range (Wilson et al. 2004). Model STN neurons
had a spontaneous firing rate of 2 Hz and displayed similar
primary and secondary ranges in the f–i curve (Fig. 3(a)). A
tertiary range in the f–i curve present
in experimental
recordings was not seen in the model neuron, and the slope
f–i curve was less steep than in the
of
experimental data.

the model

STN neurons respond to depolarizing current injection
with repetitive firing and exhibit rebound bursts at
the
cessation of a hyperpolarizing current (Hallworth et al.
2003). Model STN neurons exhibited similar patterns of
firing (Fig. 3(b)), but the rebound bursts often did not last
as long as those in the experimental recordings because of

more rapid de-activation of T-type calcium currents. STN
neurons exhibit reverse adaptation (Hallworth et al. 2003),
or an increase in firing rate over the first 10–50 action
potentials during repetitive firing. Reverse adaptation was
observed in the model STN neuron, but with a slight
decrease in firing rate after the initial acceleration (Fig. 3
(c)). Finally, spontaneous activity was delayed following
high frequency firing of the STN neuron (Fig. 4) due to
calcium accumulation during repetitive firing generating
activation of calcium-activated potassium channels (Hallworth
et al. 2003). The model STN neuron qualitatively reproduced
this firing pattern, although the delay to the start of
spontaneous activity was often longer in the model than in
the experiments.

3.1.3 Globus pallidus neurons

Globus pallidus (GP) neurons have variable firing proper-
ties and can be classified into 3 or more subtypes. Only the
“continuous repetitive firing” GP neuron reported by Kita
and Kitai (1991), similar to the “Type II” neurons reported
by Nambu and Llinas (1994), was considered in the BG
model, as in the original RT model. The firing rate of the
GP neurons observed experimentally increased almost
linearly with increased current injection, and the f–i curve
of the model GP neuron followed a similar trend, with a
slight decrease in slope with increased current (Fig. 5(a)).
This type of GP neuron exhibits weak accommodation
during the course of a depolarizing pulse (Nambu and
Llinas 1994), and although present in the model, accom-

depolarizing current injection, followed by a slight decrease in firing
rate in the model

modation was weaker than in experimental recordings
(Fig. 5(a)). Finally,
the model GP neuron exhibited a
rebound burst after release from a hyperpolarizing current

(Fig. 5(b)) similar to experimental recordings, largely due
to T-type calcium channels that were de-inactivated during
hyperpolarization.

injection. Higher firing rates
require more time for spontane-
ous activity to resume

during depolarizing current injections was observed, in which the rate
of firing of the GP cell slowed down slightly during the period of the
depolarizing pulse. (b) This type of GP cell responded with a rebound
burst after release from a hyperpolarizing pulse

3.2 Network validation

3.2.1 Firing rate and patterns

Recordings in MPTP-treated monkeys indicate that firing rate
decreases in the GPe, increases in the GPi, and increases in the
STN after administration of MPTP (Bergman et al. 1994;
Wichmann et al. 1994; Boraud et al. 1998; Wichmann and
Soares 2006). Similarly, the firing rates of STN neurons in
PD patients are higher than in non-PD patients (Steigerwald
et al. 2008). Symptom-relieving high frequency stimulation
in the STN of MPTP-treated monkeys increased the mean
firing rates of both GPe and GPi neurons (Hashimoto et al.
2003). Changes in firing rates of neurons in the BG model
were consistent with these experimental results (Fig. 6):
under the Parkinsonian condition, firing rates of STN and
GPi neurons increased, while those of GPe neurons
decreased, and the firing rates of all three types of neuron
increased during application of 130 Hz STN DBS. The
proportional increases in firing rates of STN and GPi from
the healthy to PD condition were lower than expected, while
the proportional decrease in firing rate of GPe was greater
than that
found experimentally (Boraud et al. 1998;
Steigerwald et al. 2008). The proportional increase in firing
rate of the GPi and GPe neurons during DBS was equivalent
to experimental recordings (Hashimoto et al. 2003).

In the healthy condition, the STN, GPe and GPi cells
exhibited regular firing at near constant frequencies (Fig. 7(a)).

Changes in firing patterns observed in the BG model upon
switching from the healthy condition to the Parkinsonian
condition paralleled those in the original RT model: the STN
cells exhibited more irregularity with varied interspike
intervals, and GPe and GPi neurons fired more frequently
in a burst-like manner.

3.2.2 Frequency profile

There is a distinct correlation between DBS frequency and
its effectiveness in alleviating symptoms of PD. The
beneficial effects of DBS are seen only during stimulation
with frequencies above 100 Hz, while stimulation frequen-

the firing rate for GPe decreased. DBS excited all three types of cells
and caused firing rates to increase. Standard deviation bars are shown

applied to the STN. Errors made by the thalamic cell are indicated:
misses (*), bursts (+) and spurious events (^). Under the PD condition,
GPi cells fired with more bursting, which caused the thalamic cells to
respond with more errors to input stimulus pulses. 10 Hz stimulation
did not significantly affect the network firing patterns. 130 Hz DBS
regularized the STN cells’ firing, and resulted in high frequency

regular firing in the GP cells, causing fidelity in the thalamic cells to
be restored. (b) Effect of stimulation frequency on error index of the
thalamic cells in the original RT model. DBS above 20 Hz was
effective at restoring the accuracy of thalamic transmission. (c) Effect
of stimulation frequency on error index of the thalamic cells in the BG
model. Low frequency stimulation below 40 Hz caused the rate of
errors made by the thalamic cell to remain high, while high frequency
stimulation above 100 Hz restored thalamic fidelity to its healthy
level. Standard deviation bars are shown for 20 ten-second simulations

exacerbate symptoms (Moro et al. 2002; Timmermann et al.
2004; Fogelson et al. 2005; Birdno and Grill 2008; Eusebio
et al. 2008).

Application of low frequency DBS to the STN did not
cause any significant change in the firing patterns of model
network neurons. As the stimulation frequency was
increased, STN neurons fired more regularly, synchronized
with the DBS pulses, and thereby masked the intrinsic
activity of the STN neuron. The STN cells in turn excited
GPe and GPi neurons, which exhibited high-frequency
regularized firing, as well (Fig. 7(a)).

Changes in patterns of neuronal firing during DBS
influenced the fidelity of thalamic relay. Thalamic fidelity,
quantified using the error index (EI) in the model,
is
correlated with symptom reduction in both animal models
and persons with PD (Guo et al. 2008; Dorval et al. 2010).
The profile of changes in EI versus changes in DBS
frequency in the modified BG model matched well the
profile observed clinically, while the profile from the
original RT model did not. In the RT model, DBS at

20 Hz and above was effective at restoring thalamic fidelity
(Fig. 7(b)), which is inconsistent with clinical observations
of the effects of DBS frequency on symptoms. Past studies
using the RT model or models modified from the RT model
have reported similar frequency profiles with STN DBS
(Feng et al. 2007; Pirini et al. 2009). In contrast,
low
frequency DBS (≤40 Hz) in the BG model resulted in little
or no improvement of thalamic fidelity. The EI decreased
progressively between 40 Hz and 100 Hz, and the thalamic
cell responded with fidelity comparable to the healthy
condition only at stimulation frequencies greater
than
100 Hz (Fig. 7(c)).

4 Results

4.1 STN DBS

Activation profiles obtained from two monkeys under
effective and ineffective STN-DBS (Miocinovic et al.
2006) were applied to the BG model. The error index

507

decreased between the ineffective and effective stimulation
conditions for both monkeys (Fig. 8), consistent with the
increase in DBS effectiveness observed experimentally. The
EIs for monkey R370 for both the effective and ineffective
stimulation conditions were lower than those for monkey
R7160, because monkey R370’s cathode was placed more
dorsally within the STN, resulting in greater GPi FOP
activation, as well as a greater total proportion of neural
elements activated for Monkey R370. Nonetheless,
the
activation profile of therapeutically effective parameters in
both monkeys produced greater thalamic fidelity compared
to therapeutically ineffective parameters.

Activation of both STN LCs and GPi FOPs led to an
improvement in thalamic fidelity. 130 Hz stimulation of
STN LCs resulted in high frequency regular firing of
neurons in both GPe and GPi due to the excitatory
projections from STN to GP (Fig. 9(ai)). Activation of
FOPs originating from the GPi produced regular high
frequency firing only in these GPi fibers (Fig. 9(aii)), and
since GPi had no efferent connections to STN or GPe, the
firing patterns of GPe and STN neurons were not affected
by activation of GPi FOPs. The GPi has inhibitory
connections to the thalamic cells, and regularization of the
output from the GPi resulting from either STN LC or GPi
FOP activation resulted in the thalamus receiving regular
tonic inhibition, which led to higher thalamic fidelity (Guo
et al. 2008; Dorval et al. 2010).

The combined results from all permutations of different
proportions of STN LC and GPi FOP activation indicated
that EI decreased with the increase in total percentage of
STN cells and GPi fibers being stimulated (Fig. 9(b)).
Maximal activation of only STN LC or only GPi FOP

Fig. 8 Results from BG model using proportions of STN local cell
and GPi fiber of passage activation from two animals which had
ineffective and effective STN DBS being applied at 130 Hz (Monkey
R7160: 28% STN, 10% GPi for ineffective; 38% STN, 16% GPi for
effective. Monkey R370: 32% STN, 66% GPi for ineffective; 48%
STN, 82% GPi for effective) (Miocinovic et al. 2006). Standard
deviation bars are shown for 20 ten-second simulations under each
condition. The baseline error index without DBS was 0.33. Parameters
resulting in an effective response produced a lower error index in both
animals (ANOVA p<0.001), although monkey R370 had lower error
indexes in general due to the dorsal placement of its DBS electrode

resulted in low error rates, but improved thalamic fidelity
could also be achieved by co-activation of STN LCs and
GPi FOPs. There was some benefit to activation of STN LC
over GPi FOP activation, with lower EIs produced when
only STN LCs were activated compared to when only GPi
FOPs were activated. Thalamic output was less affected by
the ratio of LC activation to FOP activation, with all ratios
resulting in a wide range of errors, dependent on the overall
level of activation (Fig. 9(c)).

4.2 GPi-DBS

Activation profiles of local GPi cells and passing GPe
fibers during GPi DBS with different electrode contacts and
voltages (Johnson and McIntyre 2008) were applied to the
BG model. Activation profiles corresponding to those
produced by stimulating middle contacts C1 and C2
produced lower EIs than activation profiles corresponding
to stimulating contacts C0 and C3 (Fig. 10). In fact,
activation profiles from stimulating contacts C1 and C2 at
2 V produced results similar to using activation profiles
from stimulating contacts C0 and C3 at 5 V.

Activation of both GPi LCs and GPe FOPs during GPi-
DBS led to higher thalamic fidelity. However, the mecha-
nism behind the decreases in EI was different for the
activation of GPi LCs and GPe FOPs. Direct stimulation of
the GPi LCs caused high frequency regular firing of the
GPi neurons and therefore a near constant
level of
inhibition to the thalamus, resulting in higher fidelity
(Fig. 11(ai)). On the other hand, activation of FOPs from
the GPe led to inhibition and silencing of neurons in both
the STN and GPi,
lesion.
Silencing of parts of the GPi in turn led to a loss of inhibition
of the thalamic neurons, which also resulted in improved
thalamic transmission compared to the Parkinsonian condition
(Fig. 11(aii)). Although these two mechanisms are
seemingly opposite in effect, they are actually compli-
mentary since they both lead to increased thalamic
transmission fidelity. If a GPi neuron receives both direct
stimulation and tonic inhibition from afferent GPe FOPs
at the same time, the efferent output would be tonic high
frequency firing (McIntyre et al. 2004).

thereby creating a virtual

Combined results from all permutations of different
proportions of GPi LC and GPe FOP activation revealed an
overall decrease in EI with the increase in the total percentage
of GPi cells and GPe fibers activated (Fig. 11(b)). Similar to
STN DBS, maximal activation of only GPi LC or only GPe
FOP resulted in low error rates, but
improved thalamic
fidelity could also be achieved by co-activation of GPi LC
and GPe FOP. Although activation of GPi LCs and GPe
FOPs had differing effects on the thalamus, either tonic
inhibition or disinhibition of the thalamus respectively, both
of these effects led to improved thalamic fidelity. Therefore

strongly correlated with improvements in thalamic fidelity. (c) Error

highlighted as examples. Multiple ratios gave equivalent error
indexes, resulting in no correlation between the ratio of LC to FOP
activation and improvement in thalamic fidelity

during co-activation of GPe FOPs and GPi LCs, the thalamic
cells experienced both disinhibition, via GPi cells inhibition
by GPe FOP activation, and tonic inhibition via GPi LC
activation, both resulting in increased thalamic transmission
accuracy. There was a marginal benefit of GPe activation
over GPi activation, with slightly lower EIs produced when
only GPe FOPs were activated as compared to activation of
only GPi LCs. Thalamic output was again less affected by
the ratio of LC to FOP activation, with all ratios resulting in
a wide range of EIs, dependent on the overall
level of
activation (Fig. 11(c)).

4.3 STN/GPi lesion

The effects of lesions in the STN and GPi on thalamic relay
fidelity were investigated by silencing different proportions

of LCs and FOPs. Silencing of STN LCs by lesioning
resulted in a decrease in thalamic fidelity because GP
neurons had a propensity to fire in bursts in the Parkinsonian
condition (Fig. 12(ai)). Silencing of GPi FOPs, however,
led to a removal of thalamic inhibition, and increased
fidelity (Fig. 12(aii)). Since silencing of STN LCs and GPi
FOPs had opposing effects on thalamic fidelity, the ratio
of STN LC silencing to GPi FOP silencing, instead of the
total percentage of neurons silenced, determined the EI
(Fig. 12(b, c)), and thalamic fidelity was restored only
when a greater number of GPi FOPs than STN LCs were
silenced.

During GPi lesioning, silencing of GPi LCs, GPe FOPs,
or combinations thereof led to increased thalamic fidelity.
Similar to silencing of the GPi FOPs, silencing of GPi
LCs removed inhibition from thalamic neurons, and the

et al. 2004; Fogelson et al. 2005; Birdno and Grill 2008;
Eusebio et al. 2008). The model revealed two distinct
mechanisms by which both DBS and lesion led to
improvements in thalamic throughput fidelity—either driv-
ing the output of the basal ganglia to reduce bursting in the
GPi, producing tonic inhibition of the thalamus, consistent
with experimental recordings (Hahn et al. 2008), and the
previous computational work of Rubin and Terman (2004)
and Hahn and McIntyre (2010); or silencing the output of
the basal ganglia to produce tonic disinhibition of the
thalamus, consistent with the classical view of the “virtual
lesion” effects of DBS. The regularized pattern of thalamic
inhibition with stimulation or lesion was in strong contrast
to the phasic inhibition of the thalamus driven by the GPi
bursting activity present in PD, and regular inhibition is
correlated with symptom reduction during DBS in MPTP
treated monkeys (Guo et al. 2008) and persons with PD
(Dorval et al. 2010).

5.1 Applications in DBS

The outcome of DBS was highly dependent on the extent of
activation of various neural elements within the basal
ganglia. Different sites of stimulation within the same
target can activate different proportions of LCs of the
target nucleus and axon FOPs from neighboring nuclei
(Miocinovic et al. 2006; Johnson and McIntyre 2008). In
general, co-activation of both LC and FOP was neither
detrimental nor advantageous as compared to selective
activation of either LC or FOP alone, when considering
only changes in EI
for both STN and GPi DBS.
Furthermore, the ratio of LC to FOP activation did not
play an important role in determining the outcome of either
STN or GPi DBS. A particular ratio of LC to FOP
activation produced a wide range of EIs, and multiple
combinations of LC to FOP activation resulted in compa-
rable effectiveness. Since the activation of the passing
fibers did not work against but instead enhanced the effect
of DBS,
the total proportion of activation of all neural
elements was the stronger influence in determining DBS
effectiveness for both STN and GPi DBS, regardless of the
ratio of LC to FOP activation. However, the present analysis
did not consider the role of activation or silencing of different
neural elements in producing side effects from DBS or lesion.
Results from the present study provide potential explan-
ations for clinical observations related to contact choice in
both STN and GPi-DBS. The model shows that activation
of GPi FOPs during STN-DBS may be beneficial to the
final outcome of the treatment. GPi fibers within the
lenticular fasiculus run dorsal
to the STN (Parent and
Parent 2004). Selection of the dorsal contacts within the
STN as cathodes would cause activation of these GPi
fibers, as well as increase co-activation of STN LCs and

Fig. 10 Results from BG model using proportions of GPi local cell
and GPe fiber of passage activation during 130 Hz GPi-DBS for four
different active contacts and two amplitudes (activation profiles for
contacts C0, C1, C2 and C3 respectively were 2 V: [42% GPi, 12%
GPe], [66% GPi, 28% GPe], [48% GPi, 34% GPe], [16% GPi, 20%
GPe]; 5 V: [72% GPi, 40% GPe], [92% GPi, 58% GPe], [90% GPi,
68% GPe], [60% GPi, 50% GPe]) (Johnson and McIntyre 2008).
Standard deviation bars are shown for 20 ten-second simulations
under each condition. The baseline error index without DBS was 0.33.
Amplitude of 5 V was generally more effective than 2 V at all contacts
(ANOVA p<0.001). Middle contacts (C1 and C2) reduced error
indexes more effectively than edge contacts (C0 and C3) (ANOVA
p<0.001)

thalamus responded more faithfully to inputs (Fig. 13(ai)).
When GPe FOPs were silenced, both the STN and GPi
were disinhibited, and GPi neurons fired at a regular high
rate. This change in firing pattern within the GPi regular-
ized inhibition to the thalamus, and the fidelity of
information relay was restored (Fig. 13(aii)). Since silenc-
ing of both GPi LCs and GPe FOPs led to a decrease in
thalamic errors, the error index decreased with the increase
in the total percentage of GPi LCs and GPe FOPs silenced
(Fig. 13(b)). There was a slight benefit of silencing only
GPe FOPs over silencing only GPi LCs. Thalamic output
was less affected by the ratio of LC to FOP silencing, with
all ratios resulting in a wide range of EIs, dependent on the
overall proportion of neurons silenced (Fig. 13(c)).

5 Discussion

We modified and validated a computational model of the
basal ganglia-thalamic network, and subsequently used this
model to investigate the effectiveness of STN and GPi DBS
as well as lesion when various proportions of local cells and
fibers of passage were activated or silenced, respectively.
The BG network exhibited characteristics consistent with
published experimental data, both on the level of single
cells and on the network level. Perhaps most notably, and in
contrast
the changes in the
thalamic error index with changes in the DBS frequency
matched well
the changes in clinical symptoms with
changes in DBS frequency (Moro et al. 2002; Timmermann

to the original RT model,

was strongly correlated with improvements in thalamic fidelity. (c)
Error index with different activation ratios of GPi LC to GPe FOP.
Results for 50% GPi LC activation (o) and 50% GPe FOP activation
(x) are highlighted as examples. Multiple ratios gave equivalent error
indexes, resulting in no correlation between the ratio of LC to FOP
activation and improvement in thalamic fidelity

GPi FOPs. Therefore, the results from the model support
the use of dorsal contacts for STN-DBS. This is consistent
with clinical studies that have shown correlations between
the location of the active contact within the target nuclei
and the outcome of STN-DBS. Retrospective studies using
magnetic resonance imaging have indicated that the dorsal
the dorsal border of the STN, and
areas of the STN,
structures dorsal
to the STN (e.g., zona incerta) are
effective sites for STN DBS in PD (Voges et al. 2002;
Hamel et al. 2003; Yelnik et al. 2003; Zonenshayn et al.
2004; Godinho et al. 2006; Yokoyama et al. 2006; Pollo et
al. 2007; Johnsen et al. 2010). Computational studies that
combined quantitative clinical outcome measures with
brain atlas models have also indentified areas dorsal to the
STN as optimal
target regions for treating rigidity and
bradykinesia (Butson et al. 2010).

Similarly for GPi-DBS, activation of GPe FOPs en-
hanced the effect of GPi-DBS on EI. GPe fibers mainly
course through the GPi (Parent et al. 2000; Sato et al.
2000), and the model supports the use of contacts within
central GPi as cathodes to maximize both GPi LC and GPe
FOP recruitment. Indeed, using activation profiles of LC
and FOP during GPi-DBS from Johnson and McIntyre
(2008), the middle contacts resulted in greater effectiveness
as compared to the contacts at the edge of the lead, and a
lower voltage could be used with similar effectiveness for
contacts located in the center of the GPi. This result is
consistent with a recent mapping of the GPi that suggested
the medial portions of the GPi as the targets during GPi
DBS for PD since more fibers traverse through these
sensorimotor regions of the GPi (Baker et al. 2010).
Another study on GPi-DBS showed that stimulating ventral

range of error indexes. Total percentage of silencing STN LCs and
GPi FOPs was not correlated with improvements in thalamic fidelity.

was only restored with GPi lesion but not STN lesion

GPi leads to improvement in levodopa-induced dyskinesias
and rigidity but worsening of akinesia and gait, while
stimulation of dorsal GPi could lead to worsening of
dyskinesias but improved gait and rigidity (Bejjani et al.
1997; Krack et al. 1998), showing that stimulating either of
the GPi polar regions is not completely ideal.

5.2 Applications in lesioning

The outcome of STN lesioning was dependent on the type
of neural element being silenced. STN lesioning was
effective when only GPi FOPs were silenced, but not when
only STN LCs were silenced. Our model showed that
without STN input, GPe and GPi cells exhibited increased
bursting activity which reduced the fidelity of thalamic
transmission, in contrast to recent findings by Hahn and
McIntyre (2010) that showed a decrease in GPi bursting
when STN was silenced. Although an increase in bursting

of GP neurons following STN lesion has been observed
experimentally (Chang et al. 2003),
the mechanism(s)
underlying this effect is unclear. It is well known that the
reciprocal STN-GPe connection is involved in the genera-
tion and propagation of oscillations in the basal ganglia
(Plenz and Kital 1999). However, lateral inhibition between
GP neurons could also play a part
in generating the
abnormal oscillations (Stanford 2003; Mallet et al. 2008).
Whether an intact STN-GPe connection is required for the
generation of these oscillations, or whether they could be
sustained by the lateral GPe-GPe inhibition or other cortical
or striatal inputs to the GPe (Magill et al. 2001; Kita and
Kita 2011) remains to be confirmed experimentally. Our
model shows that bursting in the GPe cells became more
pronounced when STN input was removed, but was
replaced by tonic high frequency firing when inhibition
from neighboring GPe cells was removed (results not
shown). This supports the hypothesis that
increased

lesioning and improvement in thalamic fidelity

bursting of GP neurons following STN lesion arises from
lateral GPe-GPe inhibitory interactions.

Our results provide a possible explanation for effects
seen during lesioning of the STN. Subthalamotomy, or
lesioning of the STN, is effective in alleviating symptoms
of PD such as akinesia, tremor, and rigidity in MPTP-
treated monkeys as well as in persons with advanced PD
(Begman et al. 1990; Aziz et al. 1991). One concern
associated with subthalamotomy for
the treatment of
advanced PD is the high rate of extreme dyskinesias or
hemiballism after surgery (Alvarez et al. 2009; Tarsy 2009).
It is thought that the size of the STN lesion is related to the
development of this side effect. In a lesioning experiment
done in normal monkeys, hemiballism was produced by
discrete lesions limited to the STN, but not larger lesions
that expanded beyond the borders of the STN (Carpenter et
al. 1950). In agreement with this finding, a clinical study of
reported that 2 out 21 patients who developed persistent

dyskinesias had subthalamotomy confined within the STN,
while subjects who did not develop side effects had lesions
that extended beyond the STN (Patel et al. 2003). However,
a consistent correlation has not been established and other
studies have shown the opposite trend (Su et al. 2002;
Alvarez et al. 2009).

Our results support the involvement of the pallidothala-
mic pathways in producing beneficial effects of STN
lesioning. Larger STN lesions that
include the passing
GPi fibers may be beneficial since silencing the output from
GPi to the thalamus increased the accuracy of thalamic
transmission, which is correlated with a reduction in motor
symptoms (Dorval et al. 2010). Lesions confined within the
STN, however, may not
in benefit, and may
contribute to the development of dyskinesias by promoting
bursting in GP neurons.

result

Following GPi lesioning, the BG model showed that
silencing of the GPi and GPe would either eliminate or

regularize basal ganglia output respectively, which both
reduced thalamic transmission errors as compared to phasic
inhibition of the thalamus. Pallidotomy, or lesioning of the
GPi, alleviates motor symptoms in advanced PD patients,
and is at times used in combination with DBS to suppress
symptoms or dyskinesias (Alvarez et al. 2009; Coban et al.
2009; Nishio et al. 2009; Kleiner-Fisman et al. 2010). In
one study that correlated position of pallidotomy with
outcome measures, the unified Parkinson’s disease rating
scale (UPDRS) motor scores improved more with posterior
and centrally located GPi lesions than with anterior lesions
(Obwegeser et al. 2008). The better results of central
pallidotomy, are consistent with the model findings, as such
lesions would not only maximize the number of GPi
neurons silenced, but also the number of passing GPe
fibers as well.

5.3 Limitations

The BG model is a biologically plausible model of the basal
ganglia-thalamic network, and uses a simple error index to
quantify the fidelity of thalamic throughput. Thalamic
fidelity is correlated with efficacy of symptom alleviation
from DBS in both animal models of PD (Guo et al. 2008)
and persons with PD (Dorval et al. 2010), providing a
quantifiable measurement of DBS and lesion effectiveness.
Using this model we examined the different factors that
affected the outcome of DBS and lesioning, and the
mechanisms involved in producing an effective response.
However, there are several limitations to be considered.

Although the model neurons were able to replicate most
patterns of
firing exhibited by biological neurons in
experimental recordings, some differences were present.
f–i curves of TH and GP cells had slopes that were either
greater or less than expected. The sigmoidal shape of the
STN cells’ f–i curve was not fully replicated due to the
absence of
the tertiary range, but such high current
amplitudes within the tertiary range were seldom used in
our simulations. Cellular firing properties reproduced some
but not all of those observed experimentally, and this could
influence the dynamics when connected within the BG
network. For example,
the model GP neuron did not
accommodate as readily as biological cells, STN cells
responded to hyperpolarizing pulses with a shorter period
of bursting, and the delay to the start of spontaneous STN
activity after a period of constant stimulation was longer in
the model as compared to biological cells. However, such
long periods of constant current stimulation followed by a
pause were not used in our simulations.

The network under healthy and Parkinsonian con-
that were
the
increase in firing rates of STN and GPi

ditions exhibited changes
consistent with reported trends in literature, but
proportional

in firing rates

neurons were lower than expected, while the propor-
tional decrease in firing rate of GPe was greater than
that found experimentally. However, even with muted
changes in firing rates in the STN and GPi, there were
significant changes in patterns of firing in GP model
cells from regular to burst-like that resulted in decreases
in the fidelity of thalamic throughput.

to the GPi

The bias currents Iapp applied to the STN, GPe, and
GPi cells were viewed as the net input from other areas of
the brain, and a decrease in Iapp in all three regions was
needed to induce bursting in the GP neurons in the
Parkinsonian condition. The decrease in applied bias
current
is not consistent with the known
decrease in inhibitory striatal input to the GPi during PD.
One possible reason for this discrepancy could be that in
addition to changes in the level of striatal input, there may
be a change in the pattern of firing (i.e.,
increase in
bursting) in the striatal neurons projecting to the GP (Kita
and Kita 2011). Hence, there may be an overall decrease
in the average amplitude of the current, but an increased
oscillatory pattern of current applied to the GPi neurons.
However, this possible effect was not captured by the BG
model, which assumed a constant Iapp to all the basal
ganglia neurons under both the normal and Parkinsonian
conditions.

The BG model used single compartment Hodgkin
Huxley type neurons and did not take into account the
three-dimensional orientation of the different nuclei, the
directions of the neuronal projections, or the position of the
stimulating electrode. Results from Miocinovic et al. (2006)
and Johnson and McIntyre (2008) provided accurate LC
and FOP activation profiles, but we were not able to
determine the exact neurons to be activated or silenced in a
given condition. Proportions of neurons being excited or
silenced in our simulations were selected at random, but
selecting continuous clusters of neurons for activation or
silencing also resulted in the same trends described for
random activation. Activation of LCs and FOPs was
achieved using intracellular current
injection to evoke
single spikes following each pulse, and this implementation
is valid because activation of either the local cells or fibers
produces the same downstream effect, regardless of the
origin of action potential. However,
the slightly higher
synaptic delay for
local cell activation compared to
activation in the fiber was ignored.

This model did not include connections from structures
outside of the basal ganglia, and other fibers of passage
surrounding the STN and GPi. For example, there are GPe
fibers projecting into and away from the STN and STN
fibers projecting through the GP nuclei (Parent and Parent
2004). These GPe FOPs near the STN, or STN FOPs near
the GPi could potentially be activated or silenced during
STN and GPi DBS or lesioning, respectively, but were not

514

J Comput Neurosci (2012) 32:499–519

considered in this model. Possible antidromic effects of
stimulation of presynaptic axons were also not considered,
although antidromic activity may influence the network
response to DBS (McIntyre and Hahn 2009).

Another limitation is that

the BG model does not
lesioning,
take into account side effects of DBS or
which are important considerations when setting param-
eters for DBS or when determining areas for lesioning.
The absence of paresthesias and dyskinesias is essential
for successful DBS and lesioning treatment. Potential
side effects could arise from the activation of motor or
sensory fibers close to the stimulation target or from
lesioning critical areas outside of the STN and GPi. For
example, stimulating either the ventral or dorsal GPi
produced side effects (Bejjani et al. 1997; Krack et al.
1998), possibly due to the spread of current outside of the
target zone. The energy required to achieve activation is
also an important consideration when selecting parameters
to maximize the lifespan of the stimulator battery (Kuncel
and Grill 2004). Although results from the BG network for
both STN and GPi-DBS showed that maximal activation
of both LCs and FOPs produced the lowest error indexes,
the high amplitudes of stimulation needed for greater
activation could also produce adverse effects, and this
should be considered when drawing conclusions from the
BG model.

6 Conclusion

Surgical intervention continues to be an option for treatment
of patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease who do not
respond well or have severe side effects from medication.
DBS and lesioning can affect both local cells within the target
nuclei and fibers of passage from neighboring nuclei, and the
relative contributions of local cell and fiber activation and
silencing were found to be variable between DBS and
lesioning. Activation of both local cells and passing fibers
during STN and GPi DBS reduced thalamic transmission
errors. During STN lesioning, silencing of GPi fibers
contributed to its effectiveness in improving thalamic infor-
mation transmission. Silencing of STN cells, however,
increased bursting of GPe and GPi neurons, resulting in a
worsening of the thalamic fidelity. This increase in GP
bursting after silencing STN local cells could be a possible
mechanism for hemiballism following STN lesioning. Finally,
following GPi lesioning, silencing of both local cells and
passing GPe fibers contributed to the increase in thalamic
fidelity. Our results may provide explanations for the
observations that lesioning and selecting active contacts in
the dorsal STN and within the central region of the GPi
produce the most desired outcomes. Better understanding of
the mechanisms behind these surgical techniques could lead to
improved surgical treatment options for Parkinson’s disease.
