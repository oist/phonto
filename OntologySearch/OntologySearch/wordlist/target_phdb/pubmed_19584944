Abstract

The main purpose of this study is to compare two different feedback controllers for the stabilization of quiet standing in
humans, taking into account that the intrinsic ankle stiffness is insufficient and that there is a large delay inducing instability
in the feedback loop: 1) a standard linear, continuous-time PD controller and 2) an intermittent PD controller characterized
by a switching function defined in the phase plane, with or without a dead zone around the nominal equilibrium state. The
stability analysis of the first controller is carried out by using the standard tools of linear control systems, whereas the
analysis of the intermittent controllers is based on the use of Poincare´ maps defined in the phase plane. When the PD-
control is off, the dynamics of the system is characterized by a saddle-like equilibrium, with a stable and an unstable
manifold. The switching function of the intermittent controller is implemented in such a way that PD-control is ‘off’ when
the state vector is near the stable manifold of the saddle and is ‘on’ otherwise. A theoretical analysis and a related simulation
study show that the intermittent control model is much more robust than the standard model because the size of the
region in the parameter space of the feedback control gains (P vs. D) that characterizes stable behavior is much larger in the
latter case than in the former one. Moreover, the intermittent controller can use feedback parameters that are much smaller
than the standard model. Typical sway patterns generated by the intermittent controller are the result of an alternation
between slow motion along the stable manifold of the saddle, when the PD-control is off, and spiral motion away from the
upright equilibrium determined by the activation of the PD-control with low feedback gains. Remarkably, overall dynamic
stability can be achieved by combining in a smart way two unstable regimes: a saddle and an unstable spiral. The
intermittent controller exploits the stabilizing effect of one part of the saddle, letting the system evolve by alone when it
slides on or near the stable manifold; when the state vector enters the strongly unstable part of the saddle it switches on a
mild feedback which is not supposed to impose a strict stable regime but rather to mitigate the impending fall. The
presence of a dead zone in the intermittent controller does not alter the stability properties but improves the similarity with
biological sway patterns. The two types of controllers are also compared in the frequency domain by considering the power
spectral density (PSD) of the sway sequences generated by the models with additive noise. Different from the standard
continuous model, whose PSD function is similar to an over-damped second order system without a resonance, the
intermittent control model is capable to exhibit the two power law scaling regimes that are typical of physiological sway
movements in humans.

Introduction

During human quiet standing, the passive stiffness of the ankle
joint, arising from visco-elasticity of the muscle-tendon-ligament
system, is lower than the growth-rate of the gravitational toppling
torque [1,2], leaving an upright unstable equilibrium of saddle
type which is characterized by a topology of a system’s phase
space spanned by the position and the velocity providing a
convergent motion toward the equilibrium in one direction (a

stable manifold) and a divergent motion away from the
equilibrium in a different direction like a mountain pass (an
unstable manifold). Thus the upright standing posture requires to
be stabilized by suitable active control strategies. Many approach-
es have been investigated for solving this problem and here we
focus on the one which has been adopted by the majority of
people: a conventional, linear, continuous-time feedback control-
ler based on proportional and derivative feedback (PD control
model) [3,4,5].

The main challenge is how to compensate the danger of
instability induced by the large neural feedback transmission delay,
which is of the order of 200 ms [6]. The standard PD model faces
a stringent trade-off that leaves narrow margins for the design of
the control parameters:
the proportional gain must be large
enough for supplementing the insufficient ankle stiffness but not
too large for avoiding delay-promoted instability. Damping of
sway patterns requires rather large values of the derivative gain but
again the feedback delay sets a stringent upper bound on this
parameter. As we show in the following, the combination of these
leaves a very narrow area in the P–D
stability constraints
parameter space where the standard controller is able to provide
stability of the upright posture.

We shall contrast the standard controller with a similar feedback
PD controller, with the difference that the feedback is switched on
and off
intermittently, according to a switching mechanism
defined in the phase plane. We aim at demonstrating that the
intermittent, non-linear controller is more robust than the linear,
continuous controller by showing that the stability region in the
parameter space is much larger in the former case than in the
latter one and, in particular, much lower values of the feedback
parameters are required. This control model
further expands
previous work on the intermittent nature of posture control [7],
focusing in particular on a formal stability analysis of such non-
linear, delayed feedback control system by means of Poincare´
maps.

Moreover, we shall also compare the two models in the
frequency domain by looking at the scaling properties of the PSD
(Power Spectral Density) of the sway patterns generated by the two
models in comparison with biological patterns. It is known indeed
[8,9,10] that the PSD function of natural sway, if plotted in a log-
log scale, can be well fitted by two linearly scaled regimes (or three
if very low frequencies are included). That is, the PSD in each
regime can be approximated as f2a, where f is the frequency in Hz
and a is
In the lower frequency band
(0.01 Hz,f,0.2 Hz) the scaling factor is about 1.5, and in the
higher band (f.0.2 Hz) it is about 3.

Methods

Four different controllers of the inverted pendulum
model of human standing

In this study, the human upright posture is simply modeled by

the motion of an inverted pendulum as

I€hh~mgh h{T

ð1Þ

where I represents the moment of inertia of human body around
the ankle, h the tilt angle, g the gravity acceleration, m the body
mass, h the distance from the ankle joint to the body CoM (Center
of Mass), T the ankle torque, and Tg~mghh the gravitational
toppling torque. The ankle joint torque T is modeled as

respectively);

In the following we consider four different implementations of
the active controllers fP and fD and analyze the corresponding
properties and performance. In Models 1 and 2 the active
feedback is linear and continuous in time. In Models 3 and 4 the
active feedback is non-linear and intermittent. Figure 1 shows, for
the four control models, the distribution of active and inactive
regions in the phase plane ( _hh vs. h).

In this case, the previous condition on the proportional gain is
still necessary but
is not sufficient. As demonstrated in the
Appendix, two additional conditions must be satisfied by the
proportional and derivative gains, yielding a set of three conditions
to be satisfied by the feedback controller for gaining the asymptotic
stability of the upright posture:

In the P–D parameter plane this identifies a triangle that
limits the set of admissible values for the feedback parameters
(see Fig. 2). When D~0, Model 2 is equivalent to Model 1. As
D decreases,
the triangle increases its area and tends to fill
the whole first quadrant of the P–D plane to the right of the criti-
cal value mgh-K. On the contrary, as D increases the triangle
decreases its area and vanishes when it reaches a critical value
 which is a function
D~ Bz
of the physical parameters of the system (m,h,I,B,K). In this study,
we consider a physiologically plausible value of D~200 ms [6],
which is fixed throughout the study and is less than the critical
value, providing the triangular stable area in the P–D plane. A loss
of stability of the upright posture occurs when DwDP{B is
broken via a Hopf bifurcation, which is a typical critical
phenomenon that induces a stable or unstable oscillatory behavior
of a dynamical system through instability of an equilibrium state,
leading to an unstable oscillation around the upright equilibrium
of unstable focus type. Indeed when D~DP{B, the real parts of

Model 3.

In this model the PD controller with time delay D is
intermittently switched on and off according to a state-dependent
mechanism, which divides the phase plane of the pendulum into
four regions separated by a negatively tilted line through the origin
and the ordinate axis: [dh=dt~ah] with 0§a and [h~0]:

Therefore the h{ _hh plane cannot be a phase plane of the system.
Nevertheless, with keeping carefully this mathematics in mind, we
refer to the h{ _hh plane as the phase plane. According to eq. 7, the
PD-on regions correspond to the first and third quadrants of the
phase plane, augmented by two angular slices (in the fourth and
second quadrants, respectively) whose amplitude is a function of
the switching parameter a. The PD-off regions fill the remaining
areas of the phase plane. The percentage PD-on vs. PD-off ranges
between 50% to 100% as a is varied between 0 and 2‘. As

becomes identical to Model 2. Let us illustrate the switching

the upright equilibrium is also
unstable of saddle type if the PD controller were always turned off.
Figure 3A shows a typical solution of Model 3 in the phase
plane. The initial state at t = 0 is represented by the thick and
nearly horizontal curve segment (labelled ‘‘1’’ in Fig. 3A) located at
upper left of the first quadrant of the phase plane, representing a

tail-end also reaches at the boundary dh=dt~ah as represented in
Fig. 3A by the nearly vertical

reaches the boundary dh=dt~ah from the off-region side, at
which the PD controller is turned on again (the state segment
labeled ‘‘3’’). Then the leading edge of the segment 3 returns to
and gets across the boundary dh=dt~ah at a point referred to
here as R2. Similar processes may be repeated as we shall analyze
in detail in this study. It is important to note that the leading edge
of the state segment labeled ‘‘3’’ in Fig. 3A is located below the
orbit connecting the segments 1 and 2. Because of this the point R2
is closer to the equilibrium than the point R1. If the leading edge of
the state segment labeled ‘‘3’’ in Fig. 3A were above this orbit, a
subsequent orbit would have returned to the boundary dh=dt~ah
at a more distant point from the equilibrium than the point R1.
Figure 3B shows another typical solution of Model 3 when the
value of P is larger than that used for Fig. 3A. In this case the initial
state at t = 0 is represented by the thick and nearly vertical curve
segment (labelled ‘‘1’’ in Fig. 3B) located at upper right of the first
quadrant of the phase plane, representing a forward tilting posture
with a velocity falling forward. The leading edge of the segment
when the tail-end reaches the boundary dh=dt~ah overflies
largely into the off-region of the fourth quadrant, due to the large

controller is turned on, off, and on, respectively.

The stability of this control model, as well as the following one,
cannot be computed by means of the standard methods (analysis of
the Bode plots, computation of the eigenvalues etc.) due to the
non-linearity and intermittency of the controllers. Instead, we shall
use Poincare´ maps

this system will be analyzed by means of Poincare´ maps.

The constant parameters used in the simulations are listed in
table 1. With these values the passive stiffness K is 80% of the
critical stiffness mgh and thus the upright posture is unstable
(saddle) without a suitable active control.

Stability analysis by means of Poincare´ maps

The trajectories in the phase plane of the sway movements
described by eq. 3, with the control provided by Model 1 or 2, can
be a stable or unstable spiral, a stable or unstable node, or a saddle
according to the values of the feedback gains P and D (PD-on
flows). Note that the classification of the flows (dynamics) depends
on the closed-loop eigenvalues: complex conjugates, with negative
real part (flow with stable spiral); complex conjugates, with positive
real part (flow with unstable spiral); both negative real (flow with
stable node); both positive real (flow with unstable node); both real
but with opposite sign (saddle flow). If no control is provided and
the intrinsic stiffness
the
corresponding PD-off flow is a saddle, which includes a stable
and an unstable manifold. If the control is intermittent (Models 3
and 4), the orbits are composed by a combination of PD-on and
PD-off
flows and the switching function described above
automatically selects an orbit along the stable manifold of the
latter flow. Therefore,
flow in the phase plane
determined by Model 3 is a sequence of unstable spiral, followed

smaller than the critical value,

The stability analysis of such non-linear dynamics can be
carried out by considering a section, transversal to the flow of the
system, known as a first return map or Poincare´ map. This map
can be interpreted as a discrete dynamical system with a state
space that is one dimension smaller than the original continuous
dynamical system (in our case this implies a reduction from a 2-

system can then be

The Poincare´ map can then be computed by choosing a leading

MS of a state segment as a starting point of an orbit and
edge s
tracking it until it reaches S again, as a new leading edge s’ of a
time evolved state segment on S. As shown in Fig. 4, an orbit from
S to S is always composed of three parts: 1) PD-on part, 2) PD-off
part, 3) the second PD-on part. There are two possible patterns
according to the specific values of the control parameters. In one
pattern (see Fig. 3B), the first part of the orbit (a curve from s to p1
in Fig. 4) is generated by a PD-on flow gON
, although the leading
edge is entering the PD-off region, because the tail-end of the state
segment still remains in the PD-on region reflecting the controller
takes a time D before detecting the switching condition due to the
feedback delay. Namely the first part of the orbit is a curve starting
MS (the leading edge of the state segment x 0,{D

from s
sð Þ (the leading edge of the state segment
t = 0), to a point p1~gON

segment reaches S at time t~D at which the PD control
is
switched off. Thus the first part of the orbit is identical to the state
segment x D,0½

need to analyze the Poincare´ map. This analysis instead is
necessary for evaluating the stability when the PD-on flow is an
unstable spiral (focus). For large values of D and small values of P,
the PD-on flow may become an unstable node and in that case the
map is not defined, which is the out of range of this study.

For the stability analysis we can restrict the map W : S?S of eq.
9 to the angular values h alone, because the knowledge of points s

we obtain the map F, a sequence of tilt angles at every transverse
of the leading edge across S can be obtained just by the iterative
use of the map. More precisely, for a given initial tilt angle h1 of a
leading edge placed on S, h2 at the subsequent transverse of the

The orbits generated by Model 4 in the phase plane are the

noise, the control is generally unable to asymptotically drive the
system to the upright equilibrium in a stable way. Rather, we
should observe a bounded stability,
typically with periodic
attractors. However, if the size of the dead zone is not too large,
in particular if the linear approximation of the sway angles is still
valid,
the areas of stability in the

Results

The control models introduced in the previous sections were
simulated in a systematic way by using different combinations of
the control parameters (P, D, a). The first issue we wished to
address was the robustness of Model 2 (continuous control) vs.
Model 3 (intermittent control). To this end, the Poincare´ map
h’ = F(h) was obtained for different combinations of the control
parameters (P, D, a). Figure 5A shows two examples of

smaller value of P corresponds to sRq1 Rq2 Rq3 Rs’ in Fig. 4 (see
also Fig. 3A). Figures 5B and 5C shows that the iterative use of the
map depicted in Fig. 5A generates a convergent sequence of values
that have a good agreement with the DDE dynamics, confirming
that the Poincare´ map can be used practically to analyze the
dynamics of Model 3. Note that the convergent sequence of the tilt
angles observed repeatedly on the Poincare´ section S is monotonic
if the slope of the map is positive, and it is oscillatory if the slope of
the map is negative.

Figure 6 shows the regions of stability in the P–D plane for
different values of the switching parameter a. We find again the
stability triangle of Model 2 which clearly does not change with a.
For Model 3,
the figure also shows the distribution in the
parameter plane of the absolute slope of the Poincare´ map |dF(h)/
dh |, in which a shading that attributes darker shade represents the
more stable conditions.

In general, we can see that

the delay-induced instability
observed in Model 2 by large values of P and small values of D
is indeed compensated by the intermittent activation of
the
feedback control. Moreover, for each value of the parameter a,
there exist optimal sets of P–D values that maximize stability. For
P–D values near the dark linear band of Fig. 6, the points p1 or q1
of the orbits when PD control is switched off (see Fig. 4), happen to
fall quite close to the stable manifold of the saddle flows, thus
leading to the most stable dynamics with ‘‘rapid convergence’’ to
equilibrium according to a ‘‘sliding motion’’ along the stable
manifold. Moreover, the fact that the dark linear band is almost
vertical implies that stability is very little sensitive to the value of D
and this means that
the delay-induced
instability by means of the intermittent activation of the feedback
does not require large values of the derivative gain D as occurs
with Model 2. In particular,
the inverted pendulum can be
stabilized even by the zero value of D in Model 3.

Figure 6. Comparison of the stability region in the P–D plane for the control Models 2 and 3. The horizontal axis is normalized with
respect to the critical stiffness (mgh) considering that the intrinsic stiffness is 80% of that value. The stability region of Model 2 is the striped triangle.
The stability region of Model 3 is the grey-shaded area, with a gray intensity which is a function of the absolute slope of the Poincare´ map: |dF/dh|h = 0
: the darker the shade the quicker the recovery of upright equilibrium. |dF/dh|h = 0 = 0 is maximal stability; |dF/dh|h = 0 = 1 is neutral stability. Dotted
areas correspond to instability (|dF/dh|h = 0.1). The four panels show how the stability of Model 3 depends upon parameter a which identifies the
switching mechanism of Fig. 1. In panels C and D, a small white thin region at the left upper edge of the gray region corresponds to parameter sets in
which the equilibrium point is a stable node. Hence in this white region, the Poincare´ map cannot be defined though the equilibrium point is stable.
doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0006169.g006

The optimal value of P, given a and D, is characterized by the
fact that the leading edge of the state segment of the PD-on flow,
after it enters into the off-region and when the tail-end of the state
segment reaches the boundary S at which the PD control
is
switched off, is located exactly on the stable manifold of the saddle
flow and this allows the state of the system to approach directly
equilibrium without the help of derivative control. If P is smaller
than the optimal value, then dF(h)/dh.0 and the PD-on flow
terminates before the leading edge reaches the stable manifold and
this yields a monotonic convergent dynamics (Fig. 5B). If P is
larger than the optimal value, the opposite occurs: dF (h)/dh,0
and the PD-on flow terminates after the leading edge reaches the
stable manifold and this yields a damped oscillatory convergence
to the equilibrium (Fig. 5C).

In any case, Fig. 6 clearly shows that the region in the feedback
parameter space where stability can be achieved is much larger for
the discontinuous control of Model 3 than the continuous control
of Model 2, suggesting that discontinuous control is a more robust
control mechanism than continuous feedback control.

Figure 7 shows typical simulated dynamics with and without
noise for each of
to be compared with
experimental data coming from a typical human subject (Fig. 8.
See [11] for the corresponding experimental setup.). Models 1 and
2 are asymptotically stable for large PD gains that are close to the

the four models,

values used in previous studies [3,4], exhibiting a rapid decay to
the equilibrium in the noise free case from the given initial
condition and a stochastic sway distribution centered around the
upright posture in the presence of noise. Model 3 also shows
asymptotic stability with a point attractor at the origin but it
requires much smaller values of the P and D parameters (P/
mgh = 0.8, D = 270 Nms/rad for Model 2 and P/mgh = 0.25,
D = 10 Nms/rad for Model 3).

Model 4 has two periodic attractors, with a positive and a
negative average angular values. In the absence of noise it settles in
one oscillatory mode or the other as a function of the initial state of
the simulation. The noise induces alternations between these two
attractors, which are more prominent
than the alternations
observed in Model 3 and this agrees with the bimodal angular
histograms observed by Bottaro et al [7].

Figure 7 also shows typical power spectra of the four control
models, to be compared with the power spectrum of human sway
(Fig. 8). In Models 1 and 2, due to the large PD gains, the PSD
profile is roughly a second order type without a resonance whereas
in Models 3 and 4 we clearly find the two power law scaling
regimes typical of human sway. Moreover, Models 1 and 2 require
much larger noise intensities to reproduce the physiologically
plausible sway amplitude than Models 3 and 4: s = 2.0 Nm in
Fig. 7A–B and s = 0.2 Nm for Fig. 7C–D.

Noise-free DDE simulations of Model 4 for various sets of P-D-a
parameters show that the stable regions in the P-D-a parameter
space of Model 4 are the same as those of Model 3, with the
difference that the attractor of Model 3 is an asymptotically stable
equilibrium point and that of Model 4 is a limit cycle. This fact
provides a common basis for understanding the noisy dynamics of
both Models 3 and 4. As shown in Fig. 7, the power spectra of
Models 3 and 4, if affected by noise, exhibit the two power law
scaling regimes that are typical of physiological sway movements.
In particular,
the low
frequency regime of Model 4 changes depending on the values of
P, a, and the noise intensity s as these parameters determine
stochastic occurrences of
the slow motions along the saddle
manifold. In the noise-free case, two limit cycle attractors coexist
in Model 4 and the state point oscillates around one limit cycle or
the other.

the first power law scaling factor at

These oscillatory patterns are characterized by the fact that PD
control is switched on for one part of the limit cycle and switched
for the remaining part. The distance between the stable
off
manifold of
the saddle dynamics that describes the system’s
behavior when PD-control is off and the leading edge of the state
segment in the phase plane when the PD control is turned off
depends on the values of P and a as we have demonstrated for
Model 3. If the distance is small, a small noise added to Model 4
can push the state point moving closely along the stable manifold
of the PD-off flow, which is a part of ‘‘the noisy limit cycle,’’ to the
opposite side of the phase plane, leading to the stochastic switching
from one limit cycle attractor to the other. If the distance is large, a
noise of
larger intensity is required to induce the alternation
between the attractors: the alternation frequency between the
attractors tends to increase with noise intensity. However, the
alternation occurs most frequently if the distance and the noise
intensity match. This could be considered as a type of a stochastic
resonance.

Figure 9 shows two examples of the PSD for Model 4 with two
different values of P (P/mgh<0.29 for the left panel and P/

mgh<0.79 for the right panel) and common values of D, a, and s
(D = 10 Nms/rad, a = 20.4 s21, s = 0.2 Nm). For this value of
the switching parameter a, the optimal value of P for the stability
of Model 3 was about 60% of mgh regardless the value of D, i.e.,
the dark band was located at P=mgh&0:6 in Fig. 6C. Thus the
values of P used for Fig. 9 left and right are, respectively, smaller
and larger than the optimal value of P. As in these two examples,
the PSD showed the two power law scaling for smaller values of P,
and it was more like a second order system and similar to the PSD
of Model 2 with or without a resonance for large values of P.

Figure 10 shows, for Model 4, the dependence of the scaling
factor a of the power spectrum of the noisy sway at the low
frequency regime, as a function of s and P for several a values with
a fixed low derivative gain D at 10 Nms/rad. For a given value of
P, a tends to be a unimodal function of s when P is close to the
optimal value taken from the dark band of Fig. 6 for which the
corresponding Model 3 exhibits the most stable dynamics (see the
unimodal curve of Fig. 10C at P=mgh&0:6 as the function of s as
a typical example). The peak value of the unimodal curve is
attained when the noise intensity matches the distance between the
stable manifold and the leading edge just after the PD control is
switched off as described above. If P is smaller than the optimal
value chosen from the left-hand side of the dark band of Fig. 6, the
unimodal curve gradually becomes monotonic increasing function
with a saturated value. The peak and the saturated values of a are
close to or larger than 1.5 depending on the value of the switching
parameter a: this is close to the physiological scaling factor [8,9,10]
and the PSD is more or less similar to Fig. 9-left, exhibiting the two
power law scaling. On the other hand,
the unimodal curve
disappears and the curves of the scaling factor a as the function of
s become almost flat close to zero or even negative if P is larger
than the optimal value, i.e., if it is taken from the right-hand side of
the dark band for which Model 3 shows damped oscillations (refs.
Fig. 5C). That is, the PSD is similar to a second order system with
or without a resonance (e.g., Fig. 9-right). In particular, the PSD
does not exhibit a resonance peak for the value of P larger than but

Discussion

The intermittent control strategy explored in this paper is based
on the idea that, in order to control the behavior of a system
characterized by a saddle-type unstable equilibrium, it is smart to
take advantage of the stable manifold of the saddle and focus the
active control intervention on the task of keeping the state of the
system as close as possible to such manifold by means of a
sequence of small, well timed control signals. This is an idea which
has been used in different fields, in order to control physical [12],
physiological [13], and clinical [14] systems. In Gibsonian terms
[15] we may say that, in spite of the instability of the saddle-type
equilibrium, the stable manifold of the saddle is an ‘‘affordance’’
that a smart agent is supposed to exploit in order to simplify the
control problem and provide a more economical solution: indeed
part of the job can be performed by the ‘‘environment’’ not the
controlling agent.

An intermittent control mechanism for continuous-time control
systems with feedback delay is similar to the ‘‘act-and-wait’’
concept proposed by Insperger [16]. The difference with respect to
our model is that the switching mechanism is periodic instead of
being event-driven: although such mechanism can be efficient, it
leaves open the choice of the switching period and, in any case,

there is no hint of biological plausibility of this type of solution in
the case of posture control.

One of the results of this study is that the intermittent PD
controller can achieve stable equilibrium with very small or even
null values of the derivative gain D. However, this does not imply at
all that the velocity information of the postural sway is not important
[5,17]. On the contrary, the estimate of sway velocity is one of the
key sensory information for switching on and off the active control in
the intermittent control at the right time. In particular, the distance
between the stable manifold of the saddle for the PD-off flow and the
point when the PD control is switched off determine the postural
stability, and it is determined by the timing of the switching off of the
PD control, for which the velocity information is critical. In this
regard, the intermittent control model proposed by Bottaro et al [7]
incorporates an internal model of the body dynamics for generating
the active control torques, by which the appropriate amount of the
intermittent and brief control
torque calculated based on the
internal model can locate the state point close to the stable manifold,
leading to a more robust stability of the quiet standing.

Figure 10. For the feedback control Model 4 (intermittent with dead zone) the figure shows the dependence of the scaling factor a
of the PSD function upon the following parameters: 1) noise intensity; 2) proportional feedback gain P(normalized with respect to
the critical stiffness mgh); 3) the slope aof the switching function. The derivative feedback gain D is fixed at the value of 10 Nms/rad. The
values of a, with appropriate choice of s, P and a, are comparable with the physiological value which is about 1.5. A: a = 0 s21. B:a = 20.1 s21.
C:a = 20.4 s21. D: a = 20.7 s21.

model has two coexisting limit cycles: noise can induce transitions
between the two attractors, resulting in multiple scaling of two
point correlation functions. In this regard,
the model above
reproduces similar dynamics to Models 3 and 4 of this study. An
important difference is that eq. 15 is derived by neglecting the
inertia term from the equation of motion in order to reduce the
analysis to a first order DDE. They justified this by assuming that
the system is overdamped, i.e. the ankle viscosity is high enough.
However, we showed in Models 3 and 4 that the total viscous
torque (including the passive viscosity B as well as the ‘‘active
viscosity’’ D) could be very small and comparable with or even
smaller than the inertia torque. Indeed, we have examined
experimental sway data to compare the inertia and viscous terms
during human quiet stance, confirming that
the inertia term
should not be neglected. Several features of the postural sway
movements suggest indeed the overdamped dynamics: the non-
resonant PSD,
the non-oscillatory impulse responses to small
perturbations, etc. However, our study demonstrates that the same
outcome can be obtained by a properly tuned ‘‘saddle mecha-
nism’’, even with a very small level of ankle viscosity.

We showed that

sway with the intermittent
activation of the PD controllers can reproduce the multiple power

the postural

law scaling property of the PSD during human quiet stance when
the upright posture is perturbed by white noise with appropriate
intensity. Note that there is one-to-one correspondence between
each power law regime of the PSD and that of the two point
correlation function, since PSD and the two point correlation
function are simply interrelated by the Fourier transform [21].
The basic mechanism underlying the two power law scaling
regimes in Models 3 and 4 is stochastic switching of the state
between left and right halves of the phase plane. In particular, the
switching occurs between two coexisting limit cycles. This is
similar to what has been shown by Milton and colleagues [18].
Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to note that continuous PD and/or
PID models, which are most popular models of
the upright
postural control, require colored noise whose spectral property is
responsible for the power law scaling at the low frequency regime.
The discontinuous, intermittent control hypothesis can provide
alternative mechanisms to generate physiological postural fluctu-
ation that can be characterized by the power law scaling at the low
frequency regime. Moreover, we showed that several physiological
parameters, such as the feedback gains of the active controller, the
condition determining the intermittent activation of
the PD
controller, and the noise intensity can change the scaling factor.

This suggests that one might be able to perform a model based
estimation of these parameter values based on the scaling factor.
This study shows that the intermittent feedback control of the
postural dynamics with ‘‘the tuned’’ on-off regions can robustly
stabilize the upright posture even with small PD gains. Small gains
provide compliant postural dynamics and thus the physiologically
plausible small amount of noise can naturally generate the
fluctuation during quiet standing [22]. The study may also
provide new insight in well studied experimental paradigms during
human quiet stance, such as the noise-enhanced sensation and
disease-induced abnormal sensation, by examining them with the
intermittent control hypothesis. Experimental paradigms with a
modification of the sensory dead-zone [23], with noise-intensity
dependent changes in the balance control [24], and with rigidity-
dependent varied ankle stiffness in patients with Parkinson’s
disease could be examined with our model. The models analyzed
in this study might be able to predict how the corresponding
parameters can affect the sway patterns.

In many different paradigms of neural control of movement has
emerged the concept that the control patterns might be organized
in well-timed, intermittent bursts or chunks: saccadic/tracking eye
movements [25], postural sway movements [17,22], visuo-manual
tracking [26,27], stick-balancing on a finger tip [28,29], cursive
handwriting [30]. Overall, the origin of the such intermittency
remains obscure and has, up to now, been viewed mainly as a
consequence of neurophysiological internal constraints that limit
the computing power of the neural controller. However, there is
the alternative possibility that intermittency has a functional role in
the control strategy of human subjects: that of maintaining the
stability of feedback control despite uncertainties about dynamic
properties of the body or manipulated objects and the large neural
delays in the transmission of the feedback signals. An example of
discontinuous, impulsive control playing a functional role, other
than in the postural control analyzed in this study,
is in the
dynamic stabilization of gait patterns: Yamasaki et al [31] showed
that impulsive, well-timed phase resetting in response to external
perturbations during the rhythmic motor control of human gait
can increase dynamics stability of motions in a better way than
conventional, continuous
feedback control, affected by large
feedback delays.

There are various sources of non-linearity in the neural control

viscosity, Coriolis coupling) and a high degree of redundancy.
When a subject has
to perform movements with external
mechanical constraints or to manipulate an object, some of the
dynamic characteristics of the resulting controlled system are not
precisely known by the central nervous system. One of the key
issues in studying motor control is to understand how the brain can
generate the appropriate command. This question is closely
related to a classical problem in robotics where manipulator
controllers have to be built in order to achieve similar tasks in such
a way that control stability is guaranteed. Such control problems
are greatly simplified by the introduction of intermediate ‘‘sliding
variables’’ [32,33]. A sliding variable is a specific combination of
the instantaneous error and its time derivative (a particular case of
composite variable). By choosing this composite variable so that
the implicit differential equation is stable, high order control
problems can be reduced to first-order problems, amenable to
qualitative feedback strategies, typically organized in intermittent
manner.

In the case of postural control x~ h, _hh

can be considered as a
sliding variable, a useful simplification that allows the brain to
greatly reduce the dimensionality of the control problem. In fact,
the formalization of the control problem by means of eq. 3 is

intermittent control model is an example of how seeking the right
