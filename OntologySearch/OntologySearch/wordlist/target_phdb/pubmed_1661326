SUMMARY 

AND 

CONCLUSIONS 

1.  A  model of the transient, low-threshold voltage-dependent 

(T-type) Ca2+ current is constructed using recent whole-cell volt- 
age-clamp data from enzymatically isolated rat thalamocortical 
relay neurons. The T-type Ca2+ current is described according to 
the Hodgkin-Huxley scheme, using the m3h format, with rate con- 
stants determined from the experimental data (22-24°C; extracel- 
lular Ca2+ concentration [Ca2’], = 3 mM). 

2.  The T-type  Ca2+ current inactivates rapidly during main- 
tained depolarization (time Constant, 
7h x  20 ms at -20  mV), yet 
recovery from inactivation is slow (time constant, r,  x  270 ms at 
-80  mV).  To  reconcile these observations, a two-step kinetic 
scheme is proposed for the inactivation  gate. Each of the time 
constants in this scheme is voltage dependent, with a maximum at 
about -85  mV (45 ms for one and 275 ms for the other). 

3.  Numerical simulations of recovery in a two-pulse, voltage- 
clamp protocol compare favorably with experimental results ob- 
tained by Coulter et al. as well as those obtained in an independent 
series of experiments with guinea pig thalamic neurons ([Ca”],  = 
10 mM). 

4.  For current-clamp simulations, a leakage current gL( v -  IQ 

is included; with  IJL = -65  mV, the calculated resting membrane 
potential is -63  mV. 

5.  It  is shown that the T-type  Ca2+ current together with  the 
leakage current suffices to describe the low-threshold spike (LTS), 
a slow, triangular-shaped depolarizing event that can be evoked 
only from relatively hyperpolarized membrane potentials and that 
underlies the burst firing of Na+-dependent action potentials in 
thalamic neurons. Outward currents are not required to reproduce 
the basic shape of the LTS. 

6. The LTS can be activated with either a depolarizing current 
step from a sufficiently hyperpolarized level or on termination of a 
hyperpolarizing current step. In either case, the amplitude of the 
LTS is a monotonically increasing, sigmoid-shaped function  of 
the hyperpolarizing current step intensity. 

7. Because of the slower kinetic step of the channel’s inactiva- 
tion gate, our model predicts that recovery of the LTS to greater 
than one-half amplitude would require a prolonged hyperpolariza- 
tion of > 100 ms (at body temperature). This imposes an upper 
limit (=  10 Hz) on the frequency of repetitive hyperpolarizations 
that can elicit a train of LTSs and hence on the frequency of any 
rhythm that requires LTS-mediated bursting of thalamic neurons. 
This finding is consistent with  the views that the T-type  Ca2+ 
current in thalamic neurons is critical  to the generation of the 
lo-Hz  spindle oscillations and that it may also play a role in the 
epileptic discharge during absence seizures.

METHODS 
Presentation of the  model 

Following Coulter et  al. (1989), we model the T-type  Ca2+ 
current in analogy with the fast sodium current of Hodgkin and 
Huxley (1952) according to 

l= = g,m3h( v -  v(-J 

(1) 
where gT is the maximal conductance per unit area (expressed in 
mS/cm2) and l?a is the reversal potential for calcium flux,  here 
fixed at + 120 mV. The value of gT may be chosen to scale the 
amplitude of &  to that measured in particular voltage-clamp ex- 
periments. 

By hypothesis, m  represents the fraction of channels for which 
one of the three activation gates is in its open state, “0,”  and h, the 
fraction of those with  the inactivation  gate in its open state. A 
channel is open if  all of its four gates are in their 0  states. Each 
activation gate satisfies a two-state transition kinetics (Fig.  1A) 
with voltage-dependent rates CY, and ,&,  so that

FIG.  1.  Kinetic  model  of the  T-type  Ca2+ channel.  A:  an activation  gate 
has 1 St-order  kinetics,  with  1 open  state 0  and  1 closed state C; the fraction 
of gates in  0  is m. B:  the inactivation  gate has kinetics  with  2 steps and  3 
states ( 1 open,  0,  and 2 closed, C1 and  C,); the fraction  of gates in  each state 
is h, s, and  d, respectively.  Step between  C1 and  0  is assumed to  be rela- 
tively  fast. Step between  2 closed  states CI  and  C2 is much  slower;  it  ac- 
counts  for  the  slow  recovery  from  inactivation.  Model  has 6 voltage-de- 
pendent  kinetic  rates: a,(V), 
,8,( V’), ar,( v), &(  V’), cy2( v), and  p2( V’). A  T- 
type Ca2+ channel  is open  when  its 3 independent  activation  gates and  its 
inactivation  gate are all  in  the  open  state. Total  current  satisfies Eq.  1. 

where the dot notation is used to signify differentiation with re- 
spect to time. In Eq. 2 we also allow for the alternative represen- 
tation  in terms of the functions m,  =  cy,/(cy,  +  &J  and 7,  = 
l/( cy,,., + ,&), which may be more directly related to voltage-clamp 
measurements. 

In several experimental studies, no effect on the kinetic behav- 
ior of T-type  Ca2+ currents was observed when the intracellular 
Ca2+ concentration was varied, when extracellular Ca2+ was re- 
placed by Ba2+ as the charge carrier, or under conditions where 
Ca2+ or Ba2+ accumulation could not occur (Carbone and Lux 
1984, 1987a; Hernandez-Cruz and Pape 1989; Nowycky  et al. 
1985). The inactivation gate of the T-type Ca2+ channel is there- 
fore regarded as insensitive to the intracellular Ca2+ concentra- 
tion. Using Eq.  2 for m  and a similar equation for h, Coulter et al. 
(1989) fit, according to a least-squares criterion, values for m,,  h,, 
7  and 7h (and the cubic power for m)  to their voltage clamp time 
c&-ses of the T-type Ca2+ current. They provided analytic expres- 
sions for m,  and h,,  but not for 7,  and rh. 

Our model extends the above treatment in three ways. First, we 
note that the preceding description accounts for the inactivation 
on a moderately short time scale (< 100 ms). It does not represent 
the slower component in the biphasic development of inactivation 
and the slow recovery from inactivation that have been reported 
for the T-type Ca2+ current (Bossu and Feltz  1986; Carbone and 
Lux  1984, 1987a; Coulter et al. 1989). To account for these effects, 
we consider a model for the inactivation gate that has two closed 
states (C, and C,) and one open (0)  state (Fig. 1B). Considerably 
lower transition rates into and out of the “deep” closed state C2 
provide the mechanism for the slower stage of inactivation. Defin- 
ing h, s, and d as the fractions of inactivation gates in the states 0, 
C1, and C2, respectively, the equations for h and d  are 

h =  a,(1  -  h -  d)  -  &h 
8=@,(1 

-h-d)-a2d 

(34 
(3b) 

where we have made use of the relation h + s + d  =  1. 

Second, by including a constant conductance leakage current, 
IL, we formulate a two-current model for the membrane free from 
voltage control. Our current balance equation takes the form 

c,ti  = -ihm3h( v -  vca) -  a( v -  w  + Lpp 

(4) 

where &.,  (pA/cm2) is the applied current. Values for the maximal 
conductances gT and gL lie in ranges that may be estimated for the 
acutely dissociated cell preparation. Assuming membrane area of 
-  1 ,OOO-2,000 pm2, we can match the amplitude of 1T under volt- 
age-clamp (range: 100-400 pA;  Coulter et al. 1989; Suzuki and 
Rogawski 1989) with gT =  0.1-0.6  mS/cm2. In  our model the 
leakage term dominates in setting a stable resting potential, vrest. 
Under  physiological conditions,  several inward  and  outward 
currents contribute to  establishing the rest state. However, the 
conductances of these currents are here presumed only  weakly 
sensitive to voltage within the range relevant to & and to the LTS. 
Therefore, we consider 1L in Eq.  4 as the summation of any such 
other currents with conductances that are relatively constant dur- 
ing the LTS. For dissociated relay neurons the input resistance 
varies over a range 0.3-2.0 GQ (Suzuki and Rogawski 1989). Thus 
we choose gL equal to 0.1 mS/cm2 to be consistent with these data 
and the aforementioned membrane area. This value of gL implies, 
for Cm =  1 pF/cm2, a resting time constant of  10 ms. For all our 
simulations we set IJL = -65  mV, which typically  leads to a value 
of  Vrest around -63  mV. The system of Eqs. 2-4 constitutes our 
minimal model, which generates an LTS and describes its slow 
recovery under current clamp conditions. 

Finally, to perform computational experiments with our model, 
we need analytic expressions for the voltage-dependent kinetic 
rate functions. These also allow us to simulate physiological behav-

We examined several possible approaches to determining the two 
equilibrium functions K1 and K2 from h,.  We noted that if K2  is 
independent of voltage, it was not possible to account adequately 
for the recovery of 1-r. This can be understood by observing that, 
according to Eq.  3b, K2 equals the occupation of the deep closed 
state C2 relative to that of C, at equilibrium. In the voltage-clamp 
recovery experiment of Coulter et al. (1989), it was found that, on 
the one hand, a brief hyperpolarization from a more depolarized 
level led to a minor initial recovery. Thus at a depolarized level the 
occupation in the deep closed state C2 should be high, and K2 
should be large, so that  during  a short hyperpolarization the 
amount of flux to the open state 0  is limited by the small fraction 
available in the Ci state. On the other hand, the complete recovery 
at a longer time scale requires that on persistent hyperpolarization 
the occupation in C2 ought to be low, and K2 should have a smaller 
value. Both requirements could not be satisfied with a fixed value 
of K2.  Therefore K2  must be voltage dependent. We settled on the 
simplifying assumption that the two transition steps in Fig.  1B 
have similar equilibrium properties, albeit with very different time 
constants: K,  =  K2  =  K.  This convenient approximation will be 
justified a posteriori by the agreement between the resulting model 
simulations and experimental observations. It  now follows from 
the steady-state solution of Eq.  3 and from Eq.  10 (see APPENDIX 
for details) that

channel.  A:  Coulter  et al. (1989)  provided  6 data  points  for  7,(  I/) along 
with  an expression  for m,(v).  This  yields 6 values for ar,( V), according  to 
Eq. 6, which  were  plotted  as log  [(Y~( v)-’  -  c]  vs. I? The  constant  C was 
adjusted  to the value  1.7 so that  a straight  line  could  be fit by linear  regres- 
sion,  which  led to the analytic  expression  for ar,( V) in Eq. 7. We obtain  Eq. 
14 for the inactivation  gating  rate a,( V) in  a similar  way (see text). B: filled 
circles  indicate  the experimentally  measured  values for 7,,  q,, and  7,. Tat- 
ter  2 are associated with  the decay rates, XI and  X2, for Eq. 3. Kinetic  time 
constant  functions  q(v)  and  r2( V), given in  terms  of X1 and  X2 by Eq. A7 
(see text  and  APPENDIX), 
are  plotted  here  with  dashed  curves (and  open 
circles  in  the case of TV). Solid  curves (top)  are according  to Eq. A6.  Solid 
curve for 7,  (bottom)  is from Eq. 8. These data correspond  to room  temper- 
ature. 

It  remains to determine 71 and 72 or, equivalently, al and cy2. 
Recall that Coulter et al. (1989, Fig. 5) described inactivation ki- 
netics with a single 7h. Their estimations were based on voltage- 
clamp data over a restricted time scale, 60- 100 ms, which is rela- 
tively  short compared with a typical recovery time from inactiva- 
tion (=250  ms). In addition, they as well as Suzuki and Rogawski 
(1989) measured a slow time constant, 7,, for the recovery process 
at a few voltage values. To represent these disparate time scales in 
our two-step model of inactivation, it seems plausible to associate 
7h with the time constant of the faster transition step between the 
states 0  and Ci  in the scheme of Fig.  1B and to attribute  the 
recovery time constant 7, to the slow step between the states Ci 
and C2. However, the correspondence is not immediate. Although 
the faster time constant is likely  unaffected by the slower transi- 
tion  process and thus is identifiable with  TV:, the recovery time 
constant certainly depends on both slow and fast processes (hence 
on 72 and 71). 

The mathematically exact time constants of our model of the 
three-state inactivation gate are XT1 and XT’ where X, and X2 are the 

842

ET  AL. 

characteristic decay rates of the system Eq.  3, a and b. These time 
constants correspond to the measurable quantities Th and 7,, re- 
spectively. In the APPENDIX 
we show how X1,2 are related to 71,2 
through a quadratic formula, and we use this to show that 

(14 
With this approximation we can substitute for 71  the experimental 
values for 7h and evaluate the right side of 

71 x  xy’ = rh 

-1 

a1 

=  q[l  +  K] 

(13) 
which follows from Eq.  9. Thereby we can obtain, as we did by 
linear regression for CY, above, an exponential function for cyl (cf. 
Fig. 2A) 

a1 = exp[-(V+  V’+  160.3)/17.8] 

(14) 
According to the definition in Eq.  9, multiplying this by K  yields 
an analytic expression for ,& (not shown here). Then 71 follows 
from l?q. 13, and it has a maximum of -45  ms near v  = -85  mV 
(Fig. 2B). 

Relatively few measurements are available for estimating the 
long time constant of Eq.  3. From the recovery experiments of 
Coulter et al. (1989, Fig. 7), we have X;’  =  220 and 243 ms at 
-  112 and -92  mV, respectively. An  additional datum for X,’  (at 
V=  -42  mV) was obtained by fitting a sum of two exponentials to 
the decay of the uninterrupted 1T transient in their Fig. 7; the time 
constant estimated for the slower phase is 135 ms. These values are 
plotted in Fig. 2B (filled circles) together with the corresponding 
values of 72 (open circles) as given by l?q. A 7. A simple form for 72 
that is consistent with these measurements (decaying at depolariz- 
ing voltage and saturating in the other direction) is the sigmoid 
function 

240 

r2 =  1 +  exp[(V  +  Vs +  37.4)/30] 

(15) 

From this expression and Eqs. 9 and 11 we get formulas for cy2 and 
p2. The graph of 72 is shown in Fig. 2B where it may be compared 
with the recovery time constant, plotted as Xi’  versus V. 

Temperature 

correction 

The time constants above correspond to room temperature (22- 

24”C), at which the voltage-clamp experiments and our simula- 
tions thereof were performed. For our current-clamp simulations, 
we adjust the rates for “body temperature” (taken here to be 10°C 
greater than the preceding conditions). These results may then be 
compared with in vivo recordings or data obtained in slice prepara- 
tions such as those reported by Thompson (1988), which were 
carried out at 34-35°C. To correct for  temperature we use Q,, 
values of 5 and 3 for activation and inactivation (both steps), re- 
spectively (see Coulter et al. 1989). Thus, at body temperature, 7, 
is multiplied by a factor of 0.2 and 71 and 72 by 0.33. 

Numerical  methods 

Our numerical simulations have been carried out using the soft- 
ware package “PHASE  PLANE”  (Ermentrout  1990) for solving 
interactively differential equations on an IBM  PC-compatible mi- 
crocomputer. For the most part, we chose the Gear integration 
method to ensure a stable and accurate numerical solution for 
equations having the property  of  stiffness (i.e., disparate time 
scales). However, we found accurate computation did not require

tained with the Gear tolerance parameter set from 0.001 to 0.09 
and maximum step size (in this variable step algorithm) set to 1 .O

the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with  a fixed time step of 
0.5 ms.

Recovery  of I,  from 

inactivation 

Although 

the  biphasic  nature  of inactivation 

is not  appar- 
ent  in  Fig.  3A,  it  becomes  so when  a  second  ZT response  is 
provoked,  as in  Fig.  3B.  Because  of the  slow kinetics 
for  d, a 
allows  only  a 
50-ms  return  step  to  the  holding  potential 
minor  decrease  in  d and  therefore  the  channel  deinactivates 
only  slightly  (h  rises from  0 to  -0.2).  The  current  Z= for  the 
to  -42  mV  shows little  recovery,  the 
second  depolarization 
if  C2 were 
ratio  of  the  two  Z= peaks  being  0.28.  In  contrast, 
absent,  and  the  kinetics  of other  steps were unchanged, 
then 
the  second  ZT peak  would  exceed  75%  of  the  first  one. 

The 

time  scale  of  transitions  between  C1  and  C2 deter- 
mines  the  relative  refractory  period  of ZT. To  quantitate 
the 
dynamics  of recovery  from  inactivation,  we have  simulated 
a series  of two-step  runs  in  which  the  latency  to  the  second 
test  step  (i.e.,  the  duration  of  the  holding  pulse)  is  varied 
(Fig.  4A).  As  the  latency 
the  slower  time 
scale  of  inactivation, 
recovery  of Z= is  achieved. 
If  we seek to  approximate 
this  process with  a single  exponen- 
tial  (Fig.  4B),  we obtain  by  linear  regression  a time  constant 
of  237  ms.  Our  analytic  expression  (Eq.  A6)  for  the  slow 
time  constant  X;’  at  -92  mV  yields  249  ms,  and  the  ap-

At  fixed voltage, the steady state of Eq. 3 determines

To approximate 72 we use the fact X1X2 = D  in Eq.  A5  and then 
eliminate X1 by using Eq.  A8  to obtain 

72  =  A,-‘[1  +  K(1  +  K)]/(l  +  m2 

(A9 
This formula shows how one should adjust the measured 7, to 
obtain 72; the factor involving K  is between 3/4 and 1. 

We remark that Eq.  A9  may also be viewed as an approximation 
for the slow time constant X2-’ of Eq.  3, which can be obtained in a 
more direct way by exploiting the time scale differences in Eq.  3. 
That is, because Eq.  3a describes a much faster process than Eq. 
3b, we use the rapid equilibrium hypothesis on the former: assume 
steady state, dh/dt = 0, and solve for h in terms of d. Substituting 
this into Eq.  3b, we obtain a single first-order equation for d, the 
decay rate of which approximates h, and which, when rewritten 
using the definitions from Eq.  9, is equivalent to Eq. A9. 

P2(1-h-d)=ar2d 

Solving these 
Eq.  9 yields 

equations in terms of the new parameters defined in

The simplification K1 = K2 = K  leads to

from which the expression for K, Eq.  11,  follows. 

The time courses of h(t) and d(t) are determined by solving the 
ordinary differential Eqs.  3, a and b, which are linear under volt- 
age-clamp conditions. Each is a sum of two exponential terms 

A0 +  A,  exp[-X,t]  +  A2 exp[-X,t] 

where 4,  and ---X2 are the characteristic roots of this second-order 
system. They satisfy the quadratic equation

Thus AI and X, are given by 

A,, x2 = ;  (l/q + l/72) t 

The directly measurable time constants in experiments are X,-r 
and X,-l  (i.e., rh and rf, respectively) rather than 71  and 72. To get 
analytic expressions for the latter, we must express them in terms 
of X1 and X2. Therefore we invert Eq.  A6  to obtain

A  useful approximation for 71 may be obtained if we factor X, 
out of the right side in Eq.  A7.  Now because the ratio X2/X1 is small 
(because 7,  @ ?h), we form a Taylor’s series expansion and retain 
only the first term to arrive at 

71 =  A,-’
