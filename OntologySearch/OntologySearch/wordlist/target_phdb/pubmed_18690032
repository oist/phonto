AbSTRAcT

Chemicals and toxins are useful tools to elucidate the structure-function relationship of 
various proteins including ion channels. The HERG channel is blocked by many compounds 
and this may cause life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia. Besides block, some chemicals 
such as the class III anti-arrhythmic agent nifekalant stimulate HERG at low potentials by 
shifting its activation curve towards hyperpolarizing voltages. This is called “facilitation”. 
Here, we report mutations and simulations analyzing the association between nifekalant 
and  channel  pore  residues  for  block  and  facilitation.  Alanine-scanning  mutagenesis 
was performed in the pore region of HERG. The mutations at the base of the pore helix 
(T623A), the selectivity filter (V625A) and the S6 helix (G648A, Y652A and F656A) 
abolished and S624A attenuated both block and facilitation induced by the drug. On 
the other hand, the mutation of other residues caused either an increase or a decrease 
in nifekalant-induced facilitation without affecting block. An open-state homology model 
of the HERG pore suggested that T623, S624, Y652 and F656 faced the central cavity, 
and were positioned within geometrical range for the drug to be able to interact with 
all of them at the same time. Of these, S649 was the only polar residue located within 
possible interaction distance from the drug held in its blocking position. Further mutations 
and flexible-docking simulations suggest that the size, but not the polarity, of the side 
chain at S649 is critical for drug induced facilitation.

INTRODucTION

Numerous	 chemical	 compounds	 and	 toxins	 interact	 with	 and	 modify	 the	 function	
of	 ion	 channels	 and	 other	 proteins.	 Most	 of	 these	 effects	 rely	 on	 the	 direct	 associa-
tion	 between	 the	 compounds	 and	 the	 proteins,	 which	 provides	 important	 information	
concerning	the	relationship	between	the	structure	and	the	function.	A	number	of	class	Ia	
and	 III	 anti-arrhythmic	 agents,	 anti-histamine	 derivatives	 and	 other	 compounds	 which	
include	antibiotics	and	tranquilizers,	are	known	to	block	the	rapidly	activating	component	
of	the	cardiac	delayed	rectifier	K+	current	(IKr),	whose	pore	forming	subunit	is	encoded	
by	a	human	ether‑a‑go‑go-related	gene	(HERG).1,2	This	block	causes	an	acquired	form	of	
QT	interval	prolongation	which	can	result	in	fatal	polymorphic	ventricular	tachycardias	
including	the	torsade de pointes.3,4	Because	of	the	clinical	importance	of	this	phenomenon	
numerous	 studies	 have	 attempted	 to	 clarify	 the	 mechanism	 of	 drug-induced	 block	 of	
HERG	and	thus	incidentally	the	structure-function	relationship	of	the	K+	channel.4,5

Many	 class	 III	 anti-arrhythmic	 drugs	 such	 as	 dofetilide	 and	 E-4031,	 are	 specific	
blockers	 of	 HERG.4	 Although	 nifekalant	 belongs	 to	 the	 same	 drug	 class,	 it	 has	 been	
reported	to	not	only	block	HERG	but	also	increase	the	channel	current	at	low	voltages.6-8	
This	“facilitation”	effect	has	also	been	seen	with	other	HERG	blockers	such	as	almokalant9	
and	azimilide.10	Details	of	the	mechanisms	underlying	the	facilitation	of	HERG	have	not	
been	clarified.

Figure 1. Facilitation of HERG currents by nifekalant. (A) Chemical structure of nifekalant. (B) The time course of HERG current inhibition by nifekalant and 
voltage-step induced facilitation. The voltage-clamp protocol is inset: membrane potential was held at -90 mV and stepped to -50 mV for 4 sec and to -80 mV 
for 1 sec. This combination was repeated every 15 sec. After allowing the current amplitude to reach a steady-state level, a depolarizing pulse to +60 mV 
for 4 sec and to -80 mV for 1 sec was applied (arrows) in the presence (filled symbols) or absence (open symbols) of 10 mM nifekalant (NF). HERG currents 
were measured at the end of the depolarizing pulse at -50 mV and normalized to the current amplitude recorded before the first application of the +60 mV 
prepulse in the absence of nifekalant. (C) Representative current traces elicited by the voltage steps to -50 and -80 mV (inset) before (i, iii) and after the 
+60 mV prepulse (ii, iv) in the absence (i, ii) or presence of nifekalant (iii, iv).

In	 the	 present	 study,	 we	 attempted	 to	 identify	 residues	 in	 the	
channel	pore	of	HERG	that	are	involved	in	both	the	blocking	and	
the	facilitation	effects	of	nifekalant.	The	residues	T623,	S624,	Y652	
and	F656	were	involved	in	nifekalant	block	of	HERG.	Similar	results	
had	 been	 obtained	 for	 other	 HERG-blockers.11-15	 Mutation	 of	 a	
number	of	other	residues	either	attenuated	or	enhanced	facilitation	
without	affecting	block.	Among	them,	S649	was	analyzed	in	detail	
because	 this	 was	 the	 only	 polar	 residue,	 which	 was	 located	 within	
range	 for	 interaction	 with	 nifekalant	 when	 the	 drug	 was	 bound	 to	
T623,	 S624,	 Y652	 and	 F656.	 Mutagenesis	 of	 S649	 to	 bulky	 resi-
dues	 caused	 a	 significant	 attenuation	 of	 facilitation	 and	 a	 modest	
reduction	of	block,	which	suggested	that	the	size	of	side	chain	rather	
than	the	hydroxyl	group	of	the	amino	acid	at	S649	was	important	
for	 the	 association	 between	 nifekalant	 and	 HERG.	 Simulations	
supported	the	notion	that	the	drug	could	interact	with	S649	while	
bound	to	T623,	S624,	Y652	and	F656.	These	results	suggest	that	a	
strong	membrane	depolarization	induces	a	change	in	the	association	
between	nifekalant	and	HERG	around	the	S649	side	chain	resulting	
in	facilitation.

MATERIAlS AND METHODS

Drug.	 Nifekalant	 (Nihon	 Schering)	 stock	 solutions	 (10	 mM)	
were	prepared	daily	in	distilled	water.	This	stock	was	diluted	to	the	

required	concentration	in	bath	solution	and	the	pH	was	adjusted	to	
7.6	when	necessary.

Site‑directed  mutagenesis  and  transcription  of  cRNA.	 HERG	
cDNA	in	pSP64	vector	was	kindly	provided	by	Drs.	M.T.	Keating	
and	M.C.	Sanguinetti	(University	of	Utah,	Salt	Lake	City,	UT).	Point	
mutations	 were	 introduced	 using	 the	 QuikChange	 Site-Directed	
Mutagenesis	 Kit	 (Stratagene)	 according	 to	 the	 manufacturer’s	
instructions.	Mutation	constructs	were	confirmed	with	direct	DNA	
sequencing.	The	pSP64	vectors	of	the	wild-type	(WT)	and	mutants	
of	HERG	were	linearized	with	EcoRI	and	transcribed	in	vitro	with	
SP6	 RNA	 polymerase	 in	 the	 presence	 of	 m7G(5')ppp(5')G	 RNA	
capping	analog	(Invitrogen).

Isolation  of  oocytes  and  injection  of  cRNA.	 Frogs	 (Xenopus 
laevis)	 were	 treated	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 guidelines	 for	 the	 use	
of	 laboratory	 animals	 of	 Osaka	 University	 Graduate	 School	 of	
Medicine.	 Isolation	 and	 maintenance	 of	 the	 oocytes	 and	 injection	
with	cRNA	were	performed	as	described	previously.16	The	cells	were	
injected	 with	 5	 ng	 of	 cRNA	 of	 WT	 HERG	 or	 each	 mutant,	 and	
incubated	 at	 18˚C	 in	 ND96	 solution	 (96	 mM	 NaCl,	 2	 mM	 KCl,		
1.8	 mM	 CaCl2,	 1	 mM	 MgCl2,	 and	 5	 mM	 HEPES,	 pH	 7.6	 with	
NaOH)	supplemented	with	50	mg/ml	gentamicin.

shown in the top panel. Membrane potential was held at -90 mV. The preconditioning prepulse was to -70 mV for 4 sec and to -80 mV for 1 sec and repeated 
with an interval of 15 sec until the steady-state was achieved. To elicit the current-voltage (I-V) relationship the membrane potential was depolarized from -70 
to +40 mV in 10 mV increments for 4 sec each and followed by 1 sec at -80 mV. Facilitation was elicited by a preconditioning prepulse to +60 mV rather 
than to -70 mV before each I-V test pulse. Typical HERG current traces evoked by the I-V protocol are shown recorded in the absence (left panel), and the 
presence of 10 mM nifekalant (NF) without (middle panel) or with the prepulse (right panel). (B) I-V relationship for steady-state currents. HERG currents were 
measured at the end of the 4 sec test pulse. Current amplitudes were normalized to that recorded at -10 mV in the absence of nifekalant. (C) I-V relationship 
for tail currents. HERG channel currents were measured at the peak during the repolarizing pulse to -80 mV. Currents amplitudes were normalized to that 
recorded following a voltage step to +40 mV in the absence of nifekalant. (D) Activation curves of HERG tail currents and the ratio of steady-state current 
to tail current. Tail current amplitude was normalized to the maximum current recorded under each condition, and the values were fit with the Boltzmann 
function. The V1/2 values were: control, -26.0 ± 0.8 mV (open circles); 11 mM nifekalant, -28.1 ± 1.5 mV (open squares); 11 mM nifekalant with the strong 
depolarizing prepulse, -44.3 ± 2.3 mV (open triangles). The conventional analysis for C-type inactivation was carried out by dividing step pulse end currents 
(B) by tail peak currents (C) in the absence of nifekalant (gray circles), and in the presence of drug with or without the strong depolarizing prepulse (gray 
squares and triangles, respectively). (E) Voltage-dependent block of HERG channel current by nifekalant. Fractional block of tail currents measured without

RESulTS

Facilitation of HERG channel currents by nifekalant.	Nifekalant	
is	 a	 class	 III	 anti-arrhythmic	 agent	 which	 blocks	 and	 facilitates	
HERG	 current	 (Fig.	 1A).6-8	 A	 strong	 depolarizing	 voltage	 step	 is	
needed	to	induce	drug-associated	facilitation	of	HERG	current.9,10	
In	Figures	1B	and	C,	the	effect	of	a	depolarizing	prepulse	to	+60	mV	
on	 the	 HERG	 current	 was	 compared	 in	 the	 absence	 and	 	presence	
of	 nifekalant.	 The	 holding	 potential	 was	 -90	 mV.	 A	 test	 pulse	 to	
-50	mV	for	4	sec	followed	by	a	voltage	step	to	-80	mV	for	1	sec	was	
applied	every	15	sec	(top	panels	in	Fig.	1B	and	C).	The	amplitude	
of	the	HERG	current	was	measured	at	the	end	of	the	test	pulse.	In	
the	 absence	 of	 the	 drug,	 the	 HERG	 current	 was	 not	 significantly	
affected	by	a	prepulse	(4	sec	in	duration)	to	+60	mV	(Fig.	1B	and	C,	
i	and	ii).	When	10	mM	nifekalant	was	added	to	the	bath	solution,	
the	amplitude	of	HERG	current	gradually	declined	to	56.1	±	8.7%	
(n	 =	 4)	 of	 the	 control.	 When	 the	 current	 reached	 a	 steady-state	
level,	 the	 depolarizing	 prepulse	 was	 applied	 again	 and	 this	 caused	
a	 clear	 increase	 in	 the	 current	 evoked	 by	 subsequent	 test	 pulses	
(Fig.	1B	and	C,	iii	and	iv).	This	is	the	phenomenon	which	has	been	
named	 “facilitation”	 by	 Carmeliet9	 and	 Jiang	 et	 al.10	 In	 the	 pres-
ence	of	nifekalant	the	amplitude	of	the	current	elicited	by	the	first	
test	voltage	step	after	the	depolarizing	prepulse	was	261.4	±	19.4%	

(n	=	4)	of	that	recorded	in	control	conditions	(Fig.	1B	and	C).	The	
facilitated	current	then	gradually	declined	to	a	steady-state	level	over	
5	 min	 (Fig.	 1B).	 The	 depolarizing	 prepulse-evoked	 facilitation	 of	
HERG	current	was	not	observed	in	the	presence	of	either	E-4031	
(0.3~3	 mM)	 or	 dofetilide	 (01.~0.3	 mM)	 (data	 not	 shown).	 Thus,	
facilitation	appeared	to	be	an	action	that	is	unique	for	the	subset	of	
HERG	blockers	which	includes	nifekalant.

Current‑voltage relationships of blocked and facilitated HERG 
currents.	To	further	characterize	facilitation,	we	analyzed	the	effect	
of	 a	 depolarizing	 prepulse	 on	 the	 current-voltage	 (I‑V)	 relation-
ship	 of	 the	 HERG	 channel	 in	 the	 presence	 of	 nifekalant.	 The	
voltage	clamp	protocols	are	shown	at	the	top	of	Figure	2A.	The	I-V	
	relationship	corresponding	to	facilitation	was	obtained	by	applying	
a	 prepulse	 to	 +60	 mV	 (4	 sec	 in	 duration)	 before	 each	 test	 pulse	
(Fig.	2A,	right	panel).

The	 I‑V	 relationships	 of	 HERG	 current	 recorded	 at	 the	 end	 of	
4	sec	test	pulses	are	shown	in	Figure	2B.	Under	control	conditions,	
the	 current	 was	 activated	 at	 potentials	 more	 positive	 than	 -60	 mV	
and	increased	until	-10	mV.	The	current	amplitude	then	decreased	
with	 the	 development	 of	 C-type	 inactivation.23	 In	 the	 presence	 of	
nifekalant,	HERG	current	amplitude	was	reduced	at	every	potential	
with	a	slightly	negative	shift	of	the	peak.	The	prepulse	to	+60	mV	
was	associated	with	an	increase	in	the	HERG	current	amplitude	at	
potentials	more	negative	than	-20	mV.	At	potentials	between	-60	and	
-40	mV,	the	facilitated	current	in	the	presence	of	nifekalant	was	not	
only	larger	than	that	recorded	in	nifekalant	without	a	prepulse	but	
it	was	also	larger	than	that	recorded	under	control	conditions.	In	the	
presence	of	the	drug,	the	amplitudes	of	peak	tail	currents	were	also	
increased	by	the	prepulse	(Fig.	2C).

Figure	 2D	 shows	 normalized	 tail	 current	 amplitude	 recorded	
in	 three	 different	 conditions,	 i.e.,	 control,	 and	 in	 the	 presence	 of	
nifekalant	 with	 or	 without	 a	 depolarizing	 prepulse.	 While	 without	
the	prepulse	the	activation	curve	of	nifekalant	blocked	current	was	
almost	the	same	as	that	of	control,	the	curve	with	the	prepulse	was	
significantly	shifted	to	the	left	(p	<	0.001).	Figure	2E	shows	the	frac-
tion	of	HERG	current	blocked	by	10	mM	nifekalant	at	each	potential	
without	facilitation.	Nifekalant	blocked	the	channel	in	an	apparently	
voltage-independent	manner.

Two	 possible	 explanations	 for	 nifekalant	 inducing	 facilitation	
of	 HERG	 current	 are	 the	 reduction	 of	 C-type	 inactivation	 and	
the	 modulation	 of	 the	 activation	 gating	 process.	The	 conventional	
analysis	for	C-type	inactivation	consists	of	dividing	currents	recorded	
at	the	end	of	a	voltage	step	by	the	peak	of	the	tail	currents.	Figure	2D	
shows	 that	 there	 was	 no	 difference	 in	 the	 voltage	 dependency	 of

V1/2, potential of half-maximal activation; k, slope of the activation curve; n, number of oocytes. Tail peak 
currents were recorded after repolarization to -80 mV followed by the voltage steps (4 sec) between -90 to 
+40 mV. *The current response of three mutants was measured at the peak during the repolarizing pulse 
to -50 mV.

C-type	inactivation	of	blocked	HERG	currents	in	the	absence	or	the	
presence	 of	 facilitation.	To	 confirm	 this,	 C-type	 inactivation	 using	
the	fully	activated	I‑V	relationship	of	HERG	was	examined	(data	not	
shown,	ref.	45).	The	voltage	dependence	of	C-type	inactivation	in	the	
presence	of	nifekalant	was	shifted	by	~5	mV	compared	to	control,	
which	is	consistent	with	a	previous	report.8	This	change	in	kinetics	
could	 enhance	 current	 block,	 but	 does	 not	 increase	 the	 current	 at	
low	voltages.	Therefore,	the	reduction	of	C-type	inactivation	seems	
unlikely	 and	 there	 remains	 the	 possibility	 that	 nifekalant	 causes		
facilitation	by	affecting	the	activation	gating	process	of	HERG.

Effects  of  alanine‑scanning  mutagenesis  on  nifekalant‑HERG 
interaction.	To	determine	which	residues	in	the	HERG	channel	were	
involved	in	block	and	facilitation	by	nifekalant,	we	replaced	each	of	
the	residues	from	the	pore	helix	to	the	selectivity	filter	(L622-V625)	
and	 in	 the	 S6	 helix	 (L646-Y667)	 with	 alanine,	 and	 examined	 the	
effect	 of	 nifekalant	 on	 the	 mutants.	 Biophysical	 parameters	 of	 the	
activation	 of	 the	 important	 mutants	 are	 summarized	 in	 Table	 1.	
Most	 of	 the	 mutants	 retained	 properties	 comparable	 to	 those	 of	
the	 wild-type	 (WT).	 The	 half-activation	 voltage	 (V1/2)	 remained	
within	10	mV	of	the	WT	value,	and	the	slope	factor	(k)	value	was	
largely	 not	 altered.	 The	 concentration	 of	 nifekalant	 required	 for	
half-maximal	inhibition	of	WT-HERG	at	0	mV	was	1.7	mM	with	a	
Hill	coefficient	of	0.99.	We	therefore	used	11	mM	nifekalant,	which	
caused	85%	inhibition	of	the	WT-HERG	current	to	characterize	the	
reactions	of	the	mutants	to	the	drug.	Because	T623A-,	V625A-	and	
G648A-HERG	mutants	showed	low	expression,	we	measured	their	
currents	with	96	mM	potassium	extracellular	solution.11

Inhibition	of	the	HERG	current	was	assessed	by	the	voltage	clamp	
protocol	illustrated	at	the	top	of	Figure	3A.	The	current	amplitude	

was	 measured	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 test	 pulse	 to	 0	 mV	 (Fig.	 3A,	 left	
panel).	Nifekalant	reduced	the	magnitude	of	most	mutant	channels	
to	a	similar	extent	as	WT-HERG	(Fig.	3Ba,	left	panel).	A	mutation	
located	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 pore	 helix	 (T623A),	 a	 mutation	 in	 the	
selectivity	filter	(V625A)	and	three	in	the	S6	helix	(G648A,	Y652A,	
and	F656A)	almost	abolished	the	blocking	effect	of	nifekalant.	These	
mutations	also	reduce	the	block	of	HERG	by	MK-499,	dofetilide,	
E-4031,	clofilium	and	ibutilide,	as	well	as	analogs	of	clofilium	and	
ibutilide.11-13,15	 The	 mutant	 V625A	 reduced	 K+	 selectivity.11,12	
Thus,	 the	 side	 chain	 of	 V625	 may	 be	 crucial	 for	 maintaining	 the	
structure	 of	 the	 selectivity	 filter	 and	 V625A	 might	 alter	 the	 inner	
surface	 of	 the	 central	 cavity	 which	 would	 indirectly	 reduce	 the	
affinity	for	nifekalant.	G648	is	conserved	in	all	voltage-dependent	K+	
(Kv)	channels	and	it	is	thought	to	function	as	a	hinge	for	bending	of	
the	S6	helix	and	channel	gating.19	The	homology	model	of	HERG	
(Fig.	4A)	suggests	that	G648	is	not	exposed	to	the	pore	and	therefore	
the	effect	of	mutation	of	G648	on	the	affinity	to	nifekalant	is	also	
due	to	an	indirect	action.	It	is	reported	that	polar	or	electronegative	
para-substituents	 on	 the	 phenyl	 ring	 of	 clofilium	 and	 its	 analogs		
associate	 with	 the	 polar	 groups	 of	 S624	 and	 T623.13	 Nifekalant	
possesses	 a	 para-nitrophenyl	 group	 at	 one	 end	 of	 the	 molecule		
(Fig.	 1A)	 and	 the	 S624A	 mutant	 showed	 less	 block	 (Fig.	 3B),		
indicating	 that	 S624	 contributes	 to	 nifekalant	 block	 of	 HERG.	
Taken	together,	four	residues	T623,	S624,	Y652	and	F656,	seemed	
to	be	involved	in	the	binding	of	nifekalant	to	induce	channel	current	
block,	as	proposed	for	other	HERG-blockers.11-13,15

Next,	 the	 facilitation	 effect	 of	 nifekalant	 was	 examined	 in	 these	
mutants.	 After	 having	 reached	 a	 stable	 state	 in	 the	 presence	 of	
nifekalant,	one	prepulse	to	+60	mV	was	applied.	The	amplitudes	of	
HERG	current	at	the	end	of	the	step	to	-50	mV	just	before	(Pre)	and	
after	(Post)	the	prepulse	(Ipre	and	Ipost,	respectively)	were	compared		
(Fig.	3A,	right	panel).	Facilitation	was	assessed	as	the	ratio	of	Ipost/
Ipre	 (Fig.	 3Ba,	 right	 panel).	 The	 Ipost/Ipre	 value	 for	 WT-HERG	 in	
the	 presence	 of	 nifekalant	 (10	 mM)	 was	 4.4	 ±	 0.37	 (n  =	 4).	 The	
mutants	(T623A,	V625A,	G648A,	Y652A,	and	F656A),	which	were	
not	blocked	by	the	drug,	did	not	show	any	facilitation.	The	mutant	
S624A,	 which	 showed	 attenuated	 block,	 exhibited	 less	 facilitation	
than	 WT.	 Of	 the	 other	 mutants	 which	 were	 blocked	 more	 or	 less	
than	WT-HERG,	some	of	them	showed	greater	facilitation	than	WT,	
while	others	showed	less	(Fig.	3Ba).	The	V1/2	values	for	the	activa-
tion	curve	measured	in	each	mutant	suggested	that	these	alterations	
in	facilitation	were	not	due	to	the	shift	of	the	activation	curve	in	the	
absence	of	the	drug.

To	 confirm	 this,	 we	 further	 analyzed	 the	 facilitation	 effect	 of	
nifekalant	in	all	of	the	mutants	listed	in	Table	1	with	a	voltage	ramp	
protocol	(data	not	shown,	but	see	Fig.	4B).	The	membrane	potential	
was	held	at	-90	mV	and	a	voltage	ramp	from	-70	to	0	mV	(10	sec	in	
duration)	was	applied	every	35	sec.	To	induce	facilitation,	a	voltage	
pulse	 to	 +60	 mV	 for	 4	 sec	 was	 applied	 10	 sec	 prior	 to	 the	 ramp.	
Thus,	we	could	distinguish	whether	the	facilitation	was	due	to	the	
drug	effect	or	the	alteration	of	an	intrinsic	biophysical	property	of	the	
HERG	mutants.	With	the	ramp	protocol,	the	facilitation	of	HERG	
currents	 could	 be	 clearly	 measured	 at	 potentials	 between	 -60	 and	
-30	mV	(WT	in	Fig.	4B).	All	of	the	mutants	that	showed	a	facilita-
tion	response	to	the	step-pulse	protocol	(Fig.	3Ba)	clearly	exhibited	
a	left-ward	shift	of	activation	during	the	ramp	which	resulted	in	an	
increase	in	the	current	amplitude	at	-50	mV.	Therefore,	drug-induced	
facilitation	was	due	to	the	consequence	of	drug-channel	interaction

potential of -90 mV in either the absence (Cont) or the presence of nifekalant (Drug). Right column: in the presence of nifekalant, the currents were elicited 
by test pulses to -50 mV for 4 sec and then to -80 mV for 1 sec from a holding potential of -90 mV, before (Pre) and after a single depolarizing pulse to 
+60 mV (Post). (Ba) The effects of alanine substitution screening upon block and facilitation of HERG currents by nifekalant. Normalized block (Idrug/Icont) 
was calculated by dividing the current amplitude recorded after the application of nifekalant by the current recorded under control conditions. Normalized 
facilitation (Ipost/Ipre) was calculated by dividing the current amplitude recorded following the strongly depolarizing prepulse by the current recorded before 
the prepulse (n = 4-6 for each, error bars; ± s.e.m.). N.T.; not tested, N.E.; channels that lacked functional expression. (Bb) The relationship between block

WT but stronger facilitation than WT (triangles); (iii), mutants showing the same degree of block as WT but weaker facilitation than WT (circles). Symbols

of	the	mutants.	Because	facilitation	of	current	is	due	to	a	left-ward	
shift	of	the	HERG	activation	curve,	any	step	between	drug-channel	
interaction	 and	 activation	 gating	 can	 influence	 the	 phenomenon.	
Therefore	it	is	not	unexpected	that	most	of	the	amino	acids	in	the

Figure	3Bb	summarizes	the	relationship	between	block	and	facili-

but	 larger	 facilitation	 than	 WT;	 and	 (iii)	 a	 group	 showing	 block	
equivalent	to	WT-HERG	but	less	facilitation	than	WT.	These	results	
suggest	that	the	extent	of	facilitation	did	not	correlate	with	that	of

the open channel conformation of HERG was based on the crystal structure of the KvAP channel (PDB ID: 1ORQ). Two subunits have been omitted from the 
front and the back for clarity. Side chains of amino acids crucial for drug block and facilitation of HERG current are represented as stick models. Side chains 
of residues presumably involved in the direct association with nifekalant are shown with spheres. Carbon and oxygen atoms are colored yellow and red, 
respectively. (B) Representative currents from HERG channels mutated at S649. A voltage ramp protocol from -70 to 0 mV was applied to test HERG mutants 
S649A, S649T, S649V, S649I and S649L for nifekalant-induced block (green) and facilitation (red). These currents were superimposed onto that recorded 
in the absence of nifekalant (black). Dashed lines indicate zero current level. (C) The effects of nifekalant on block and facilitation of currents from HERG

places	a	clear	limitation	upon	the	use	of	an	homology	model	based	
on	KvAP.	However,	because	C-type	inactivation	was	not	affected	by	
nifekalant	(Fig.	2)	the	homology	model	should	provide	some	useful	
information	on	the	interaction	between	the	HERG	channel	and	the	
drug.	The	model	showed	that	the	side	chains	of	amino	acids	T623,	
S624,	Y652	 and	 F656	 are	 exposed	 to	 the	 central	 cavity.	This	 is	 in	
agreement	with	the	mutational	analysis	that	suggests	that	these	resi-
dues	were	responsible	for	the	binding	of	nifekalant	to	HERG	(Fig.	3).	
These	residues	therefore	contribute	to	the	direct	association	between	
nifekalant	and	HERG.

At	the	present	time,	T623/S624,	Y652	and	F656	are	thought	to	
interact	with	respectively	polar,	ionized	and	hydrophobic	regions	of	
HERG	 blockers.4,14,24	 According	 to	 pharmacophore	 analysis,25,26	

the	 distance	 between	 ionized	 and	 hydrophobic	 regions	 in	 different	
HERG	blockers	ranges	from	5.2	Å	to	9.1	Å.	On	the	other	hand,	the	
model	showed	that	the	center	of	the	aromatic	ring	of	Y652	was	about	
8	Å	distant	from	that	of	F656.	This	may	imply	that	if	the	drug	inter-
acts	with	Y652,	it	cannot	extend	beyond	the	side	chain	of	F656	to	
the	cytoplasmic	side.	Therefore,	the	drug	should	interact	with	amino	
acid	residues	located	around	the	central	cavity	of	HERG.

Because	drug	binding	is	a	prerequisite	for	facilitation,	the	position	
of	the	drug	in	the	channel	pore	cavity	causing	facilitation	should	be	
confined	to	within	the	limits	that	are	required	for	binding.	Mutation	
of	the	distal	S6	helix	near	the	cytoplasmic	side	of	the	channel	exhib-
ited	 different	 magnitudes	 of	 facilitation,	 while	 maintaining	 WT	
block.	The	 mutants	 G657A,	 N658A,	 V659A,	 and	 L666A	 showed

little	facilitation,	while	S660A,	I663A,	Q664A,	R665A	and	Y667A	
exhibited	 greater	 facilitation	 than	 WT	 (Fig.	 3B).	 Because	 these	
residues	are	predicted	to	be	located	physically	too	far	from	the	drug	
which	is	restricted	to	its	binding	site,	they	may	not	directly	interact	
with	the	drug	but	participate	indirectly	in	drug-induced	facilitation.
Because	nifekalant	binding	is	a	prerequisite	for	facilitation,	there	
may	be	overlap	between	the	interactions	between	the	channel	pore	
residues	 and	 nifekalant	 that	 cause	 block	 and	 facilitation.	 But	 there	
may	 also	 be	 a	 specific	 interaction	 associated	 with	 facilitation.	This	
interaction	 for	 facilitation	 requires	 a	 strongly	 depolarizing	 prepulse	
in	 the	 presence	 of	 the	 drug.	 Upon	 strong	 depolarization,	 the	 basic	
nitrogen	at	the	center	of	nifekalant	may	shift	in	the	outward	direc-
tion.	 Within	 the	 restriction	 that	 block	 requires	T623,	 S624,	 Y652	
and	F656,	S649	is	the	only	polar	amino	acid	residue	within	range	of	
the	drug	size.	The	hydroxyl	group	of	S649	is	3.9	Å	to	6.6	Å	distant	
from	the	side	chains	of	T623,	S624,	Y652	and	F656.25,26	Therefore,	
while	the	alanine	substitution	at	S649	did	not	have	a	significant	effect	
on	facilitation	(Fig.	3),	from	a	geometrical	standpoint	this	amino	acid	
might	be	a	key	residue	for	nifekalant’s	induction	of	facilitation.	To	
test	this	hypothesis,	we	examined	the	effects	of	various	mutations	of	
S649	 on	 nifekalant-induced	 block	 and	 facilitation,	 and	 compared	
them	with	mutations	of	S624,	which	contributes	to	the	binding	of	
nifekalant	for	block.

Amino	acid	substitutions	at	both	S649	and	S624	did	not	cause	a	
dramatic	 alteration	 in	 the	 voltage	 dependence	 of	 HERG	 activation	
(Table	1).	Nevertheless,	we	applied	ramp	pulses	to	assess	drug-induced	
facilitation	(Fig.	4B).	Currents	were	recorded	during	the	continuous	
change	 in	 voltage	 from	 -70–0	 mV	 in	 the	 absence	 of	 drug	 (black	
lines),	and	in	the	presence	of	the	drug	with	or	without	a	depolarizing	
prepulse	 (red	 or	 green	 lines).	 Nifekalant	 reduced	 the	 WT-HERG	
current	at	potentials	more	positive	than	-40	mV,	while	the	drug	obvi-
ously	 increased	 the	 current	 amplitude	 at	 potentials	 between	 -60	 to	
-30	mV	when	a	prepulse	to	+60	mV	had	been	applied.	The	currents	
of	 S649A	 and	 S649T	 mutants	 were	 blocked	 by	 nifekalant	 to	 the	
same	extent	as	WT-HERG,	while	the	currents	of	S649V,	S649I	and	
S649L	were	much	less	reduced.	While	the	drug-induced	facilitation	
was	nearly	the	same	as	WT	in	the	S649A	mutant,	it	was	negligible	
in	 the	 mutants	 S649T,	 S649V,	 S649I	 and	 S649L.	 These	 results	
strongly	suggested	that	different	mutations	at	S649	yielded	different	
	sensitivities	to	nifekalant,	leading	to	block	and	facilitation.

To	 quantitatively	 analyze	 the	 effect	 of	 mutations	 on	 nifekalant-	
induced	block	and	facilitation,	voltage	steps	to	0	mV	and	-50	mV	
were	 applied	 for	 the	 assessment	 of	 block	 and	 facilitation	 effects	 of	
the	drug,	respectively	(Fig.	4C).	For	comparison,	we	analyzed	various	
mutants	at	S624	and	S629.

Substitutions	 of	 S624	 to	 alanine	 or	 threonine	 caused	 moderate	
reductions	in	block	and	facilitation	due	to	nifekalant	(Figs.	3	and	4B	
and	4C).	Even	though	asparagine	has	a	volume	similar	to	threonine,	
the	 S624N	 mutant	 was	 completely	 insensitive	 to	 the	 drug.	 These	
results	indicate	that	not	only	the	size	of	the	S624	side	chain,	but	also	
its	hydroxyl	group,	is	crucial	for	drug-HERG	association,	supporting	
the	 proposal	 that	 S624	 participates	 in	 the	 binding	 of	 nifekalant	 to	
the	channel	pore.	Figure	4Da	shows	that	there	is	a	strong	correlation	
between	drug-induced	block	and	facilitation	for	the	S624	mutants.	
This	agrees	with	the	idea	that	the	drug	binding	is	a	prerequisite	for	
facilitation	(Fig.	3).

On	 the	 other	 hand,	 the	 alanine	 replacement	 at	 S649	 did	 not	
	significantly	 affect	 either	 block	 or	 facilitation	 (Figs.	 3,	 4B,	 4C	

Figure  5.  Flexible  docking  simulation  of  the  association  of  nifekalant  with

described in ‘Materials and Methods’. The simulations were performed with 
constraints  for  the  association  of  nifekalant  with  T623,  S624,  Y652  and 
F656 to mimic the mode of current block (A), and with T623, S624, S649, 
Y652  and  F656  to  mimic  the  mode  of  current  facilitation  (B).  Forty  differ-
ent solutions developed by each simulation are superimposed in the HERG

and	 4Db).	 However,	 even	 though	 threonine	 is	 only	 27	 Å3	 larger	
than	 serine,	 the	 S649T	 mutation	 caused	 a	 prominent	 reduction	
in	 drug-induced	 facilitation	 without	 an	 obvious	 effect	 on	 block.	
Because	 both	 serine	 and	 threonine	 possess	 a	 hydroxyl	 group	 on	
their	 side	 chains,	 the	 contribution	 of	 the	 hydroxyl	 group	 of	 S649	
to	 nifekalant-induced	 facilitation	 may	 be	 insignificant.	 Therefore,	
the	reduction	of	facilitation	caused	by	the	threonine	substitution	at	
S649	may	be	due	to	the	increase	in	volume	of	the	side	chain.	Further	
increasing	size	at	S649	by	the	substitution	of	bulky	amino	acids	such	
as	 valine,	 isoleucine	 and	 leucine	 caused	 slight	 progressive	 further	
attenuation	 of	 facilitation.	 It	 also	 caused	 progressive	 reduction	 in	
block,	 which	 correlated	 well	 with	 the	 size	 of	 the	 residues.	 These	
results	can	be	interpreted	as	implying	that	the	size	of	the	side	chain	
at	 the	 position	 of	 S649	 is	 critical	 for	 drug-channel	 interaction	 for	
facilitation	 and	 that	 it	 is	 also	 involved	 in	 the	 interaction	 for	 block	
although	in	the	latter	case,	the	size	effect	is	much	less	sensitive.

on	 the	 association	 of	 the	 drug	 only	 with	 T623,	 S624,	 Y652	 and	
F656.	This	should	simulate	the	drug-channel	interaction	for	block.	
In	Figure	5A	the	geometrical	arrangement	of	the	drug	is	shown	for	
the	forty	successive	examples	with	the	highest	score	(i.e.,	the	lowest	
value	of	the	sum	of	electrostatic	interaction	and	van	der	Waals	force	
for	channel	amino	acid	and	drug	interaction).	Nifekalant	is	situated	
in	a	pocket	surrounded	by	T623,	S624,	Y652	and	F656.	But	even	
under	 these	 conditions	 it	 was	 noticed	 that	 S649	 was	 located	 near	
the	drug	and	seemed	to	form	a	part	of	the	pocket.	This	is	consistent	
with	the	mutational	analysis	that	indicated	that	nifekalant	could	be	
positioned	in	close	vicinity	to	the	side	chain	of	S649	during	block	
without	facilitation	(Fig.	4).

We	then	added	the	requirement	for	an	association	between	S649	
and	 nifekalant	 in	 a	 simulation	 of	 drug-channel	 interaction,	 which	
would	correspond	to	their	association	during	facilitation.	The	forty	
successive	 simulation	 results	 with	 the	 highest	 score	 are	 shown	 in

which	 compared	 with	 only	 one	 approach	 out	 of	 forty	 without	 the

nifekalant	can	interact	with	S649	while	retaining	its	association	with	
the	four	amino	acid	residues	that	are	important	for	block,	i.e.,	T623,	
S624,	 Y652	 and	 F656.	 This	 supports	 the	 notion	 that	 S649	 may	
play	an	important	role	in	the	depolarization-induced	facilitation	of	
HERG	current	in	the	presence	of	nifekalant.

DIScuSSION

Nifekalant‑HERG  association  for  current  block.	 The	 HERG	
channel	allows	a	spectrum	of	compounds	different	in	size	and	shape	
to	interact	with	it	and	prevent	ion	flow.	The	computational	analysis	
of	 the	 three-dimensional	 stereoelectronic	 characteristics	 of	 HERG	
blockers	 have	 identified	 at	 least	 four	 pharmacophores	 distributed	
in	 these	 chemical	 compounds.13,25-27	 These	 studies	 showed	 that	
a	 tertiary	 amine	 in	 the	 middle	 of	 these	 compounds	 is	 the	 most	
crucial	feature	of	HERG	blockers.	The	basic	nitrogen	center	of	the	
compounds	 is	 thought	 to	 be	 protonated	 at	 physiological	 pH	 and	
involved	 in	 the	 cation-p	 interaction	 with	 Y652	 on	 the	 S6	 helix.14	
The	 other	 pharmacophoric	 features	 are	 hydrophobic	 moieties,	
mainly	 consistent	 with	 aromatic	 rings.	 One	 of	 these	 hydrophobic	
moieties	associates	with	the	benzyl	group	of	F656	on	the	S6	helix,	
presumably	based	on	p-stacking	interaction.11,14,28	The	other	hydro-
phobic	moiety	is	predicted	to	lie	adjacent	to	points	sensitive	to	steric	
and	 electrostatic	 properties.26	 From	 the	 mutational	 analysis	 of	 the	
HERG	 pore	 using	 clofilium	 and	 ibutilide	 analogs,	 Perry	 et	 al.13	
demonstrated	that	the	hydroxyl	groups	of	T623	and	S624	function	
in	association	with	polar	or	electronegative	para-substituents	with	the	
phenyl	ring	of	the	drugs.	As	shown	in	Figure	4A,	the	HERG	pore	
model	for	the	open	channel	state	indicated	that	all	of	these	residues,	
T623,	S624,	Y652	and	F656,	exposed	their	side	chains	to	the	central	
cavity.	Taking	into	account	the	geometrical	constraints	of	the	phar-
macophore,26,27	HERG	blockers	would	interact	and	be	located	at	the	
top	of	the	pore	cavity	during	the	block	of	ion	flow.

But	 Cavalli	 et	 al.26	 reported	 that	 one	 of	 the	 hydrophobic	
	pharmacophores	permitted	structural	variation	among	the	blockers,	
suggesting	that	the	position	of	drugs	was	not	restricted	to	within	the	
central	cavity.	The	structure	based	drug-binding	models	for	terfena-
dine	and	cisapride27	and	MK-49911	and	HERG	showed	that	these	
blockers	occupied	an	entire	region	of	the	HERG	pore	cavity.	Here,	

the	 flexible	 docking	 simulation	 of	 channel-drug	 interaction	 used	 a	
homology	model	of	the	HERG	pore	based	on	KvAP	structure.	The	
simulation	 constrained	 nifekalant	 to	T623,	 S624,	 Y652	 and	 F656	
on	 the	 same	 HERG	 subunit	 (Fig.	 5A)	 and	 strongly	 suggested	 that	
the	 entire	 drug	 molecule	 is	 positioned	 in	 the	 pocket	 at	 the	 top	 of	
the	HERG	pore	cavity	and	that	it	does	not	extend	beyond	F656	in	
the	 cytoplasmic	 direction.	 This	 simulation	 could	 also	 support	 the	
mutation	results	that	indicated	that	the	drug	may	be	located	in	close	
vicinity	to	S649	even	during	block	without	facilitation	(Figs.	4C,	4D	
and	 5A).	 In	 addition,	 the	 simulation	 suggested	 the	 possibility	 that	
F656	on	the	adjacent	HERG	subunit	may	also	participate	in	forming	
the	 binding	 pocket	 for	 nifekalant,	 even	 though	 the	 constraint	 was	
confined	 to	 four	 amino	 acids	 on	 the	 same	 channel	 subunit.	Thus	
residues	 on	 several	 subunits	 may	 participate	 in	 the	 association	
between	 nifekalant	 and	 HERG.	 This	 result	 also	 supports	 the	 idea	
of	 a	 heterogeneous	 nature	 for	 the	 drug-binding	 site	 of	 the	 HERG	
channel	pore	that	has	been	indicated	by	the	effects	of	different	drugs	
on	the	mutant	Y652A.	While	the	mutant	Y652A	is	not	blocked	by	
HERG-blockers	 such	 as	 nifekalant	 (Fig.	 3),	 MK-499,	 clofilium,	
ibutilide,	dofetilide	and	E-4031,11-13,15	it	is	blocked	by	vesnarione,	
propafenone	and	bepridil.15,29,30	Systematic	measurements	of	effects	
of	various	HERG	blockers	on	HERG	channel	mutants	would	shed	
light	on	the	divergent	mechanisms	of	drug-HERG	interaction.

Nifekalant‑HERG association for current facilitation.	A	strong	
depolarized	 voltage	 step	 is	 a	 prerequisite	 for	 nifekalant	 to	 evoke	
facilitation	 (Fig.	 1).	 This	 characteristic	 allowed	 us	 to	 examine	 the	
residues	 responsible	 for	 drug-induced	 facilitation	 of	 HERG	 sepa-
rately	 from	 block	 (Fig.	 4).	 We	 have	 identified	 the	 possibility	 that	
S649	is	involved	in	nifekalant-induced	facilitation.	Either	the	volume	
or	other	properties	of	the	side	chain	of	S649	appeared	to	influence	
the	interaction	between	HERG	and	nifekalant	for	facilitation.	The	
mutational	analysis	of	S649	indicated	that	in	block	without	facilita-
tion	 nifekalant	 seemed	 to	 be	 located	 close	 to	 the	 S649	 side	 chain,	
but	not	to	interact	directly	with	it	(Fig.	4).	This	was	supported	by	
the	 flexible	 docking	 simulation.	The	 difference	 between	 the	 facili-
tated	and	the	purely	blocked	conditions	for	the	association	between	
nifekalant	 and	 HERG	 is	 caused	 by	 a	 prior	 strong	 depolarization.	
Although	at	present	it	is	unclear	whether	the	depolarization	causes	a	
conformational	alteration	in	nifekalant	or	in	the	HERG	pore	region,	
the	 flexible	 docking	 simulation	 with	 the	 addition	 of	 S649	 showed	
that	 it	 was	 possible	 for	 nifekalant	 to	 reach	 the	 side	 chain	 of	 S649	
while	retaining	its	association	with	other	binding	residues.	This	result	
is	consistent	with	our	hypothesis	that	S649	is	a	critical	residue	for	the	
facilitation	effect	of	nifekalant.

The	 facilitation	 of	 HERG	 by	 its	 blocker	 has	 been	 reported	
with	other	compounds	such	as	almokalant9	and	azimilide.10	It	was	
suggested	 that	 azimilide	 might	 interact	 with	 residues	 at	 the	 outer	
mouth	of	the	HERG	channel	to	induce	facilitation.10	But	we	found	
that	mutations	in	this	region	lost	the	channel’s	selectivity	for	K+	and	
C-type	 inactivation.	 It	 is	 therefore	 difficult	 to	 determine	 whether	
these	 residues	 are	 involved	 in	 the	 facilitation	 of	 HERG	 current	 by	
nifekalant.

Possible  gating  mechanism  underlying  nifekalant‑induced 
 facilitation of HERG current.	There	are	at	least	two	possible	mecha-
nisms	for	HERG	current	facilitation	induced	by	nifekalant.	The	first	
is	 that	 nifekalant	 may	 attenuate	 C-type	 inactivation	 of	 the	 HERG	
channel	at	low	voltages	and	thus	apparently	shift	the	activation	curve	to	
more	negative	voltages.	Azimilide	did	not	induce	detectable	alterations

in	 the	 inactivation	 time	 course.10	 Nifekalant	 shifted	 the	 voltage	
dependence	of	C-type	inactivation	by	at	most	~-5	mV	(Fig.	2D	and		
ref.	8).	This	effect	may	enhance	the	drug-induced	block,	but	cannot	
lead	to	an	increase	of	current.	Thus,	it	seems	unlikely	that	facilitation	
of	current	by	nifekalant	is	caused	by	attenuation	of	HERG	channel	
C-type	inactivation.

The	second	possibility	is	that	the	drug	affects	the	activation	gating	
process	 itself.	 Crystal	 structures	 of	 various	 K+	 channels	 reveal	 that	
the	inner	pore	helix	corresponding	to	S6	in	HERG	alters	its	position	
during	 gating.31	 Our	 mutations	 of	 residues	 on	 the	 distal	 S6	 helix	
caused	either	an	increase	or	a	decrease	in	the	facilitation	associated	
with	 nifekalant	 (Fig.	 3).	 But	 these	 residues	 are	 unlikely	 to	 directly	
interact	with	the	drug	because	of	the	geometrical	constraints	of	the	
pharmacophores	 and	 the	 positions	 of	 the	 amino	 acids	 involved	 in	
drug	binding.	The	distal	S6	helix	is	currently	thought	to	be	respon-
sible	for	channel	activation	gating.	Therefore,	the	substitution	of	the	
side	chains	along	the	S6	helix	would	itself	either	enhance	or	attenuate	
channel	gating.

Whereas	 similar	 negative	 shifts	 of	 activation	 curves	 have	 been	
reported	during	the	modulation	of	other	ion	channels	including	b-ad-
32	and	L-type	Ca2+	channel	currents,33	
renergic	enhancement	of	IKs
the	precise	mechanisms	have	not	been	elucidated	so	far.	The	associa-
tion	 of	 nifekalant	 and	 S649	 led	 to	 the	 alteration	 of	 the	 activation	
gating	 mechanism	 of	 HERG.	 Therefore,	 this	 type	 of	 regulation	
of	 activation	 gating	 may	 be	 one	 of	 the	 control	 mechanisms	 of	 ion	
channel	activation,	which	can	be	modified	by	chemical	compounds	
and	protein	phosphorylation.

It	has	been	reported	that	many	chemicals	can	increase	ion	channel	
currents	by	acting	on	various	ion	channel	properties.	Among	them,	
the	activation	gating	mechanism	is	one	of	the	important	targets	for	
chemicals	acting	on	the	channel	pore.	Bay	K	8644,	a	dihydropyri-
dine	 derivative,	 enhances	 L-type	 voltage-dependent	 Ca2+	 channels	
by	altering	the	channel	mode	from	I	to	II.34,35	In	this	case,	not	only	
is	the	channel	open	time	increased	but	also	the	activation	curve	of	
the	channel	shifts	in	the	negative	direction.	Similar	alterations	were	
reported	for	the	actions	of	BDF	919836	and	pyrethroid	insecticides37	
on	voltage-dependent	Na+	channels.	In	the	case	of	TRPC5	which	is	
inactive	in	control	conditions,	S-nitrosylation	at	the	N-terminus	of	
pore	helix	causes	opening	of	its	activation	gate.38	Further	studies	are	
needed	to	clarify	how	the	interaction	of	chemicals	with	channel	pores	
results	 in	 alteration	 of	 ion	 channel	 activation	 gating	 mechanisms.	
This	 will	 be	 of	 help	 to	 further	 elucidate	 the	 relationship	 between	
structure	and	function	in	ion	channels.

Mechanistic and clinical significance.	We	confirm	that	nifekalant	
is	 associated	 with	 the	 facilitation	 of	 HERG	 current,	 and	 that	 pure	
IKr	 blockers	 E-4031	 and	 dofetilide	 exhibit	 no	 such	 effect.	 It	 was	
reported	 that	 nifekalant	 effectively	 suppresses	 ventricular	 tachyar-
rhythmias	not	only	in	canine	models,39-42	but	also	in	patients	with	
acute	myocardial	infarction	or	severe	ventricular	dysfunction.43	The	
effectiveness	 of	 nifekalant	 against	 lethal	 ventricular	 arrhythmias	
might	be	related	to	its	effect	of	facilitating	HERG	channels.	In	this	
context	it	is	interesting	to	note	that	while	the	reduction	of	HERG	
channel	current	by	E-4031	increased	the	magnitude	of	rate-depen-
dent	action	potential	duration	(APD)	alternans	in	a	computer	model	
of	canine	endocardial	myocytes,44	increasing	HERG	channel	current	
by	shifting	the	activation	curve	to	more	negative	voltages	abolished	
APD	alternans.39	Nifekalant	not	only	blocks	HERG	current	but	also	
induces	facilitation	via	a	negative	shift	of	the	activation	curve.	This	

drug	is	therefore	likely	to	have	a	lower	risk	for	induction	of	alternans	
and	may	thus	be	more	appropriate	for	the	treatment	of	arrhythmias	
than	pure	IKr	blockers.	Further	studies	on	the	detailed	mechanism	of	
facilitation	should	be	useful	for	the	logical	design	of	clinically	effec-
tive	IKr	blockers	with	reduced	proarrhythmic	effects.
