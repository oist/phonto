We propose an analog-digital hybrid circuit model of one-dimensional cardiac tissue with hardware implementation that allows us to perform real-time simulations of spatiallyconductingcardiacaction potentials. Each active nodal compartment of the tissue model is designed using analog circuits and a dsPIC microcontroller, by which the time-dependent and time-independent nonlinear current-voltage relationships of six types of ion channelcurrents employed in the Luo-Rudy phase I (LR-I) model for a single mammalian cardiac ventricular cell can be reproduced quantitatively. Here, we perform real-time simulations of reentrant excitation conduction in a ring-shaped tissue model that includes eighty nodal compartments. In particular, we show that the hybrid tissue model can exhibit real-time dynamics for initiation of reentries induced by uni-directional block, as well as those for phase resetting that leads to annihilation of the reentry in response to impulsive current stimulations at appropriate nodes and timings. The dynamics of the hybrid model are comparable to those of a spatially distributed tissue model with LR-I compartments. Thus, it is conceivable that the hybrid model might be a useful tool for large scale simulations of cardiac tissue dynamics, as an alternative to numerical simulations, leading toward further understanding of the reentrant mechanisms.

Dysfunction of electrical excitations and their spatial propagation in cardiac myocytes can induce abnormal contractions of the heart, leading to life threatening arrhythmias. Some arrhythmias are perpetuated by reentrant mechanisms, in which a local excitation conducts through a part of the heart to recirculate back to the original site. This reentry cycle time can be shorter than the normal cycle of a cardiac pacemaker, leading to the rapid heart beat referred to as a reentrant tachycardia. To better understand electrophysiological mechanisms of the reentrant arrhythmias at the cellular, tissue, and organ levels, mathematical models of cardiac cells, tissues, and the heart have been developed in order to simulate the propagation of excitations in a variety of conditions. However, it is inevitable for those models to become large scale in the number of dynamical variables, requiring immense amounts of computational time for their dynamic simulations. Here, we introduce an analog-digital hybrid circuit model of electrical excitation of a cardiac cell based on the Luo-Rudy phase I model, a typical mathematical model for a cardiac cell. The hybrid circuit model, through its hardware-implementation, allows us to perform real-time simulation of cellular excitations as well as their propagation in a network of hybrid cell models as a cardiac tissue model. The hardware-implemented tissue model inherits the real-time capability of the single hybrid cell model, independent of the size of the tissue network. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt to design and implement a hardware circuit model of spatially distributed cardiac tissue with biophysically detailed ion channel currents responsible for cellular excitations.
 
I. INTRODUCTIONGO TO SECTION...
 
Contraction of a cardiac myocyte is triggered by a membrane action potential, which is controlled by transmembrane currents through various types of ion channels.1,2 Major ion currents include the fast inward Na+ current, the transient outward K+ current, the slow inward Ca2+ current, the slow delayed rectifier K+ current, and the slow delayed rectifier K+ outward current, among others. A cardiac action potential, referred to also as excitation, is often generated in response to a supra-threshold current stimulation. The excitability of the cell decreases for a period of time after a prior excitation, causing the refractoriness of the cell. The heart consists of a huge number of such excitable cells,3 about 20 million myocytes in adult rats4 and about 800 million myocytes in human ventricles,5 connected locally by the gap junctions that allow spatial conductions of action potentials through the heart tissue. Thus, the heart is a typical large scale excitable medium that can potentially exhibit reentry excitations such as spiral waves of conducting excitations.6?11 Some cardiac arrhythmias are perpetuated by reentrant mechanisms, in which a local excitation conducts through a part of the heart to recirculate back to the original site, causing a rapid heart beat referred to as reentrant tachycardia.12
Methodologies that have been employed so far to theoretically understand the nonlinear dynamics of excitable media include mathematical modelings with computer simulations as well as electronic experiments that utilize hardware-implemented nonlinear circuits, by which experimentally observed dynamics of real-world excitable media have been reproduced and analyzed qualitatively and/or quantitatively. The use of mathematical models with computer simulations is favorable because of their large capability for describing physical and/or physiological mechanisms in detail, allowing practically one-to-one correspondence between parameters in the models and real physical quantities. Indeed, mathematical models of the ventricular cardiac action potential in single cells have continued their remarkable development and improvement after the Hodgkin-Huxley formulation13 with the gating theory of conductance-based ion channel dynamics, initiated in the first modeling attempt by FitzHugh14 and Noble,15 continued by Beeler and Reuter,16 Luo and Rudy,17?19 and many others including models with Markov-type channel kinetics,2 until today as described in Refs. 2 and 20?22. A large number of detailed physical state variables have been introduced in recent models in order to take new experimental observations at the cellular, sub-cellular, and molecular levels into account.22?25 Therefore, some of the recent studies at the tissue and organ levels try to use such detailed biophysical models to investigate excitation conductions in heart tissue.26?31 However, tissue models, as well as whole ventricle models, should consist of a large number of single cell models, which causes a new problem in the amount of computations required to obtain meaningful steady-state dynamics from their simulations.32,33 Due to this drawback, it is a still challenging issue to simulate dynamics of cardiac tissue models consisting of the latest detailed single cell models as their compartmental nodes. In this respect, it is also important to develop minimal models that can quantitatively reproduce the variety aspects of dynamic characteristics, such as restitution curves, of detailed biophysical models and use them for tissue level simulations.34,35
Hardware-implemented excitable media have their own long history of investigation, comparable to that of the mathematical models, as traced back to circuits of excitable systems proposed in the 1960s (Refs. 36?38). In particular, Nagumo et al.37 demonstrated that their active transmission line involving nine active nodal compartments could simulate propagating action potentials along a nerve axon, in which each active node was implemented by a tunnel diode with an N-shaped current-voltage (I-V) relationship mimicking the one in the Bonhoeffer-van der Pol model.39 Advantages to developing hardware-implemented excitable media include their capability for performing real-time computations of their dynamics, independent of the size of the system, i.e., the number of excitable nodal compartments used in the systems, as well as their potential use in medical engineering applications. Although fewer attempts40 have been made for hardware implementation of spatially distributed excitable media after Nagumo et al., developments of circuit models mimicking neuronal and cardiac cellular dynamics have been continued. Hoshimiya et al.41 proposed an electronic circuit model of excitable membrane realized by a single time-dependent (transient) I-V relationship determining a total membrane current through different types of ion channels. Maeda et al.42,43 and Sekine et al.44,45 constructed analog circuit models with two or three ion channel currents in which I-V relationships were activated at different time scales in order to simulate bursting or pacemaker type neuronal excitations. These circuit models are beneficial for studying the nonlinear dynamics of excitable media qualitatively. However, due to the qualitative design of their I-V relationships, it is usually difficult to establish explicit correspondence between the currents in a hardware circuit model and the ion channel currents of an excitable cell unlike in the case of the mathematical models. Only a few studies have succeeded to design analog circuits that are biophysically detailed and have quantitative correspondence to a real cell.46
One of the main issues for studying excitation conductions in the field of cardiac physiology and pathology is understanding how the action potential conduction and reentry dynamics at the tissue level are influenced by cellular level dysfunction of specific ion channels28,47?49 that cause abnormal cellular excitation such as in long QT syndrome.50 In order to provide comprehensive answers to this sort of question using a mathematical or hardware circuit model of cardiac tissue, it is required for every cellular model (compartmental node) used in the tissue model to include physiologically and quantitatively plausible models of ion channel currents rather than simple and qualitative models.
Recently, we have proposed a hardware circuit model of an excitable cell that can quantitatively reproduce the action potential generation and phase-locked and chaotic responses to periodic current pulse stimulations observed in the Luo-Rudy phase I (LR-I) model17 for a mammalian cardiac ventricular cell based on comparisons in the action potential waveforms and bifurcation diagrams that shows parameter regions for various phase-locked dynamics.51 Here, we first report a slightly modified version of the circuit model briefly. We then propose a model of a spatially distributed extension of a one-dimensional cardiac tissue with its hardware implementation. The circuit model allows us to perform real-time simulations of spatially conducting cardiac action potentials. In particular, we show that the circuit tissue model can exhibit real-time dynamics for initiation of the reentry induced by uni-directional block and for phase resetting that leads to annihilation of the reentry in response to impulsive current stimulations at appropriate locations and timings. The dynamics of the hybrid model are compared to those obtained numerically by the LR-I model in order to demonstrate that the circuit model can be utilized for simulating large scale cellular network in real-time as an alternative to numerical simulations.
 
II. BRIEF SUMMARY OF LUO-RUDY I MODEL AND ANALOG-DIGITAL HYBRID ACTIVE CIRCUIT OF A CARDIAC CELLGO TO SECTION...
 
A.  Luo-Rudy I model
The LR-I model is described by a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations that includes eight dynamic state variables with six types of ion channel currents. The ion channel currents are the fast inward sodium current INa, the slow inward current Isi carried mainly by calcium ions, the time-dependent potassium current IK, the time-independent potassium current IK1, the time-independent plateau potassium current IKp, and the background current Ib carried by sodium, potassium, and calcium ions. See Fig. 1 for an equivalent electrical circuit where Vm is the membrane potential. The voltage source in each channel represents the electro-chemical Nernst potential of the corresponding ion. The six ion channel currents are summed to give the total channel current Iion as in Eq. (1). Placing Iion in parallel to the current through the capacitive component of the membrane circuit Cm yields Eq. (2) for the total current flow Im through the membrane,
Iion=INa+Isi+IK+IK1+IKp+Ib,
(1) 
Im=CmdVmdt+Iion.
(2) 
Note that the membrane current Im corresponds to, and is always equal to, stimulation current applied externally to the membrane.

B.  Hybrid cell model
The analog-digital hybrid active circuit for a single cardiac cell, referred to here as the hybrid cell model, includes analog circuits and the digital circuit of a dsPIC microcontroller. The core part of the hybrid cell model was designed as shown in Fig. 2. Four out of the six ion channel branches were designed using analog circuits, and the remaining two branches were lumped together using the single dsPIC. The action potentials of the hybrid cell model were produced by injecting external current stimulations, Iext, which should be equal to Im in Eq. (2). A validation criterion for each of the six branches in the hybrid cell model to be quantitatively close to the corresponding ion channel in LR-I model was set if the transient and/or steady-state nonlinear I-V relationships of the ion channel in LR-I could be reproduced quantitatively by the circuit branch in the hybrid cell model. The analog circuits were used to implement the time-independent ion currents of IK1, IKp, and Ib, and the time-dependent fast sodium current INa which has a relatively short time constant. We designed each of these analog circuits by exploiting the intrinsic voltage-current relationships of bipolar transistors (Tr), resistors (R), capacitors (C), and voltage sources to reproduce the steady-state I-V relationships for IK1, IKp, and Ib, and the transient as well as the steady-state I-V relationships for INa. An electronic circuit simulation tool (Altium Designer version 6, Australia) was utilized to design these analog circuits. IK and Isi were reproduced by the digital part of the hybrid cell model using a 16-bit high-performance dsPIC30f4011 microcontroller (Microchip Technology, USA) with a processing speed of 120 MHz. To increase the speed of calculation, we accessed certain data from pre-constructed lookup tables stored in the memory (ROM) rather than calculating the functions in equations which represent the ion channel currents. In particular, seven nonlinear static functions (Éød, É¿d, Éøf, É¿f, ÉøX, É¿X, and Xi) of the membrane potential Vm were stored as tables in ROM for a range of Vm between ?100 and 120 mV with a resolution (step) of 0.5 mV. For Vm values between the resolution step of the table, the nearest value of the table was used as an output of each function. See supplemental material66 for details.

Let us illustrate how the hybrid cell model behaves by referring to Fig. 3. We start with a voltage signal at the terminal 1 of Fig. 3, which is identical with the terminal 1 of Fig. 4, corresponding to the cardiac cell membrane potential Vm. This Vm is fed into the port of a 10-bit analog to digital converter of the dsPIC at terminal 3 of Fig. 3, sampled with a frequency of 2.5 kHz. IK and Isi are then computed in the dsPIC at each instant of time for a given Vm to generate the output voltage from the digital part at the terminal 4 of Fig. 3 through a 10-bit digital to analog converter. This output voltage is proportional to the sum of IK and Isi, determining the value of V digital that is fed-back into the analog circuit. The amount of externally injected pulsatile stimulus current Iext is given by a command voltage pulse Vext. The voltages Vdigital, Vext, and the membrane potential Vm are summed up to generate the potential difference between Vdigital?+?Vext?+?Vm and Vm as Vdigital?+?Vext which induces the current ?IK???Isi?+?Iext by using the resistor R7. KirchhoffÅfs laws applied at the T-shaped branch at the upper part of the capacitance C1 of Fig. 3 ensure that the sum of ?IK???Isi?+?Iext, ?INa???IK1???IKp???Ib, and ?C1dVm/dt is equal to zero. That is, the equality
?C1dVmdt?Iion+Iext=0,
(3) 
holds as in Eq. (2).
The time scale of the analog-digital hybrid cell model was set to be the same as that of LR-I model. The current and voltage scales of the analog-digital hybrid cell model (milli-ampere and volt) were not the same as those of the LR-I model (micro-ampere and milli-volt). The scale conversions of the voltage and the current were performed because the values of the ionic currents and the membrane potential in LR-I model were too small and difficult to handle on the scale of the analog circuits. In particular, we converted the scales as follows: 8 É A of LR-I to 3 mA of the hybrid cell model, ?100 mV of LR-I to 0 V of the hybrid and 120 mV of LR-I to 5 V of the hybrid cell model. In formulae, the scale conversions of the voltage and the current are expressed as follows:
VLR?I[mV]+100220Å~5ILR?I[É A]Å~(38)Å®Å®Vhybrid[V]Ihybrid[mA].

The action potential waveform for the single cell produced by the LR-I model is shown in Fig. 6(a) in order to compare with that produced by the hybrid cell model shown in Fig. 6(b) with the original voltage/current scales and in Fig. 6(c) with the converted scales. An impulsive stimulation with a duration of 1 ms and an intensity of 80 É A was applied to LR-I and also to the hybrid cell model, showing that the action potential waveform produced by the hybrid cell model was quantitatively the same as that by LR-I model. In particular, both models showed almost the same action potential duration (APD): about 350 ms. Moreover, it was confirmed that the dynamics of the hybrid cell model, in response to periodic current impulse trains with a variety of the period, reproduced the corresponding dynamics of the LR-I model well.51 See supplemental material to confirm the extent to which the I-V relationships of the hybrid cell model could reproduce those of the LR-I model.66 Major differences observed at the period after the initial rapid depolarization for about 100 ms were due to a variability of analog devices (mainly the operational amplifiers) and the I-V relationship of INa as discussed later in Sec. V.

III. REENTRANT ACTION POTENTIAL CONDUCTION IN ACTIVE CABLE MODELSGO TO SECTION...
 
Propagation of action potentials in an excitable tissue is often modeled by a continuous excitable medium, leading to a model described by a reaction-diffusion equation. In particular, we consider a spatially one dimensional and homogeneous medium. Thus we have
Å›Vm(x,t)Å›t=DÅﬁ2Vm(x,t)?Iion(x,t)Cm+Iext(x,t)Cm,
(5) 
where Vm(x,t) is the cardiac cellular membrane potential at position x and time t, ?2 is the second derivative with respect to the position x, Cm?=?1.0 É F cm?2 is the membrane capacitance, D?=?(CmS ÉÀÉœ)?1 is the diffusion coefficient, where S ÉÀ and Éœ are the surface-to-volume ratio of the cardiac cells and the longitudinal tissue resistivity of cardiac muscle, respectively. According to the literature that use models of one and two dimensional cardiac tissues,26,52 we consider the case where Sv?=?5000 cm?1 and Éœ?=?0.2 kÉ∂cm, leading to D?=?1 cm2 s?1 which is D?=?10?3 cm2 ms?1. Iion(x,t) is the ion channel current at position x and time t. Here, the Iion is specified by the LR-I model. Iext may also be position dependent if the externally applied current is spatially distributed. More specifically, we consider a one-dimensional ring of LR-I active cable as a model for exhibiting a circus movement reentry, which is thought to be a typical mechanism of anatomical reentrant cardiac arrhythmia. Here, a ring of length L?=?4.7 cm is considered. Practically, this length was selected due to the number of hybrid cells available, and it might not be long enough for supporting a reentry excitation on the ring. This is because the typical conduction velocity of an action potential is about 60 cm/s in cardiac tissue,53 resulting in a period of reentry about 78 ms for the ring. This reentry period is much smaller than a usual APD (about 150?200 ms) during conduction. In order to enable the ring to support a reentrant action potential, it was necessary to modify the dynamics of every single hybrid cell compartment so that the APD became smaller than usual. To this end, we modified the time scale of the Isi current dynamics of each cell for both LR-I and hybrid models. That is, the rate functions Éød(Vm), É¿d(Vm), Éøf(Vm), É¿f(Vm) for the d and f gates of determining the Isi dynamics for each of all LR-I and hybrid cell compartment models were doubled so that the time constant functions É—d(Vm) and É—f(Vm) were halved, resulting in a shorter APD in every single compartment. The modification could be performed easily for the hybrid cell models because the dynamics of Isi were implemented in each dsPIC used for each hybrid cell model. Although physiological situations corresponding to this modification is not necessarily obvious, we considered that it was not a problem for our purpose to examine whether the hybrid model could reproduce the corresponding LR-I dynamics.
The forward Euler spatial discretization with É¢x for Eq. (5) gives the ordinary differential equation of the compartment model at position x of the LR-I cable as follows:
dVm(x,t)dt=D(É¢x)2(Vm(x+É¢x,t)?Vm(x,t))+D(É¢x)2(Vm(x?É¢x,t)?Vm(x,t))?Iion(x,t)Cm+Iext(x,t)Cm.
(6) 
For numerical simulation of the LR-I cable, we segmented the ring into N?=?80 compartments, i.e., É¢x?0.058cm. This is equivalent with considering the gap junction resistivity between every adjacent compartments as Rd?=?3.45 kÉ∂cm2. For the one-dimensional tissue cable, the compartment model with a set of ordinary differential equations can then be represented as
CmdVimdt=1Rd(Vi+1m?Vim)+1Rd(Vi?1m?Vim)?Iiion+Iiext,
(7) 
where i?=?1, ÅEÅEÅE, N?=?80. Vim and Iiion are the membrane potential and the ion channel current of ith compartment, respectively. Note that (i???1) refers to N for i?=?1 and (i?+?1) refers to 1 for i?=?N, because of the ring geometry of the model. That is, the 1st and the Nth compartments are connected by the gap junction of resistivity Rd. The non-ring shaped cable that has two open ends (referred to as the open-end cable) can also be established by disconnecting the 1st and the Nth compartments, and it was used just for a comparison with the ring cable. This set of ordinary differential equations together with channel gating dynamics of every compartment for the LR-I were integrated numerically using the explicit Euler method with time step É¢t?=?0.001 ms. With these parameters, the linear stability criterion (É¢x)2/É¢t?>?4D is satisfied.
Although we tried to have quantitative reproduction of this LR-I cable model as much as possible using a ring-topology-network of 80 hybrid cell compartment models, it was required to modify the value of the gap junction resistance to Rd?=?2.35 kÉ∂cm2, by which the conduction velocity of the action potential along the hybrid cable model became almost the same as that of the LR-I cable model as shown below.
Figure 7 shows non-conducting action potential waveforms of the single isolated cell models and conducting action potential waveforms of single cell compartment models embedded in the open-end as well as the ring cables. In particular, it was examined how the APD was altered by the modification of the Isi dynamics and by the excitation conduction through the gap junction connection in the hybrid cell and the hybrid cable models as well as in the single LR-I and the LR-I cable models. In both Fig. 7(a) for the hybrid models and Fig. 7(b) for the LR-I models, the action potential with the largest APD of about 350 ms is from the single isolated cell models with the original Isi dynamics in response to a single current pulse stimulation applied to the cell model at the resting potential. The second largest APD of about 300 ms in each of the hybrid and LR-I models is from the conducting action potential along the open-end cable also in response to a sequence of current stimulations separated by a long time interval (1000 ms). The stimulations were applied at one end of the cable, and the action potential was recorded at the middle point of the cable during steady state dynamics of the periodically stimulated cable. The conduction velocity was about 35 cm/s for the open-end hybrid cable and about 31 cm/s for the open-end LR-I cable. The modification of Isi dynamics reduced APD in the single isolated cell models as in the third largest APD of Fig. 7, where APD of the non-conducting action potential was about 150 ms for the single isolated hybrid cell model and about 100 ms for the single isolated LR-I. Differences in APD between the hybrid cell model and LR-I was due to a variability of analog devices and the I-V relationship of INa (see discussion in Sec. V). Action potential conduction on the ring cable with the modified Isi dynamics reduced APD furthermore. In this case, APDs in the hybrid model and the LR-I model were about 100 ms and 80 ms, respectively, for non-reentrant conducting action potentials that were evoked by a sequence of long-time-separated current pulses applied at one point of the ring. The conduction velocity in this non-reentrant conduction was also about 35 cm/s for the hybrid ring cable and about 31 cm/s for the LR-I ring cable. APD was the shortest for the reentrant action potential with the modified Isi dynamics both in the hybrid ring and LR-I ring cables. It was about 70 ms in the hybrid ring cable and about 60 ms in the LR-I ring cable. The conduction velocity of the reentry was about 32 cm/s for the hybrid ring cable and about 28 cm/s for the LR-I ring cable. The reentrant conduction velocities obtained in the ring geometry were slower than those in the cable because the ring was effectively paced more rapidly, thereby invoking conduction velocity restitution. These conduction velocities during reentry are slower than the physiological conduction velocity,53 but they are comparable to those obtained by some of previous studies.54 In summary, the hybrid and the LR-I cables showed quantitatively similar characteristics in APD and conduction velocity for both with original and modified Isi dynamics, although we should discuss detailed differences between Figs. 7(a) and 7(b).

For the circus movement reentry to occur in the ring-shaped LR-I and the hybrid cable models with the modified Isi dynamics, an unidirectional block of conducting action potentials and the presence of an excitable gap are required where the excitable gap is defined as a spatial interval of the medium with enough excitability on the ring. Here, the unidirectional block was induced by using the so called S1-S2 protocol,12,54 in which single or several (usually equally time spaced) impulsive stimulations referred to as S1 were applied at a given location on the ring, and then another impulsive stimulation referred to as S2 was applied at a different location from the S1 site.
Panels (a) and (b) in Fig. 8 show space-time diagrams showing changes in the membrane potential as a function of time and position along the ring during initiation of reentry in the hybrid and LR-I cable models, respectively. See MPG video supplemental material66 demonstrating the reentry dynamics observed in the hybrid circuit model. Quantitative reproduction of LR-I cable dynamics by the hybrid cable model can be confirmed. We used impulsive stimulations for S1 and S2 with a duration of 1 ms and an intensity of 150 É A. In each figure, two S1 stimulations are applied to the ring at the compartment of number i?=?1 (the bottom of the spatial axis in the panels), pacing the excitation of the medium. Each stimulus evokes excitation at the stimulated site, generating two conducting action potentials. One propagates clockwise and the other counter-clockwise along the ring. As is common in excitable media, each conducting action potential possesses a wave-front and a tail. The wave-front progressively excites the compartments ahead of the wave-front, and the wave-tail is accompanied with refractoriness that decreases as it becomes distant from the action potential. These two conducting action potentials eventually collide with each other at the opposite side of the stimulated site, leading to annihilation of the action potentials due to the refractoriness located at each of the wave-tails. The S2, corresponding to an ectopic focus excitation in the real heart, is then applied at a position (the compartment number i?=?18) slightly away from the S1 site at an appropriate time interval after the second application of S1. In order to initiate the reentrant wave, the S2 must be applied when the action potential generated by the S1 has passed through the S2 site and refractoriness of the wave-tail is still large in the one side of the S2 site (near side of the leaving action potential, referred to here as refractory side) but the excitability has regained on the other side referred to here as excitable side. The S2 with this specific timing generates an action potential that can propagate only to the excitable side (unidirectional block). Since the action potentials generated by the S1 are annihilated eventually, the single action potential generated by the S2 alone remains, initiating the circus movement reentrant wave.

In both models, Isi dynamics were modified to reduce APD so that the small ring could support the reentry. Arrow heads represent two S1 and single S2 stimulations. For the hybrid cable model, the membrane potentials were recorded only for the compartments 1, 4, 8, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, and 80, using a 24 ch recording device with analog-to-digital converters.
 
The cycle length of the reentry in its steady state was T?LR=165ms for the LR-I cable and that for the hybrid cable model was T?hyb=149.3Å}1.6ms (mean?Å}?SD). The variability of the cycle length was only for the hybrid cable, and it was due to the random nature of the real circuit. As shown in Figs. 7 and 8, APD after the initiation of reentry was about 70 ms which was shorter than those generated in response to S1 stimulations in both the LR-I and hybrid cable models. This is because the wave-front of the reentrant wave is always chasing the wave-tail, and thus excitability of the ring cable cannot be fully recovered.
For delivering S1 and S2 stimulations to the hybrid cable model, we constructed an impulsive stimulator by using an H8/3694F microcontroller to control the timings of the stimulations systematically. See Appendix for details of the circuit. Moreover, details of the electronic components and the source program written into the H8 microcontroller are described in the supplemental material.66
 
IV. RESETTING AND ANNIHILATION OF REENTRY IN ACTIVE CABLE MODELSGO TO SECTION...
 
Glass and his colleagues as well as other groups have been establishing a theory to handle this issue based on the phase resetting of nonlinear oscillators.55?62 Here, we utilize their theory for the LR-I and the hybrid ring cable models with modified Isi dynamics to show that the latter behaves satisfactorily as the former.
In the numerical and hardware experiments below, single and/or finite sequences of impulsive current stimulations were delivered to the ring cable models that support the reentry excitation as shown in the previous section. Those stimulations with the same stimulus intensity as in the unidirectional block experiment were applied again at the compartment of the number i?=?18.
Panels (1a)-(1c) and (2a)-(2c) in Fig. 9 show space-time diagrams exemplifying the responses of the reentrant excitation to single stimulations as a function of time and position in the hybrid and LR-I ring cable models, respectively. One could observe a good coincidence between the dynamics of the hybrid and the LR-I ring cable models. In both Figs. 91(a) and 92(a), the stimulation was applied at the fully refractory side of the wave-tail of the reentry. Thus the stimulus failed to generate any propagating action potentials, less affecting the original reentry. In both Figs. 91(b) and 92(b), the stimulus was applied at a slightly later time instant than (1a) and (2a), generating a single action potential propagating only in a clockwise direction to collide with the originally counterclockwise propagating action potential, leading to the annihilation of the reentry. This result suggests that a single stimulation delivered at an appropriate time interval referred to here as the annihilation interval, at which the wave-tail of the original reentry is located slightly away from the stimulation site, could annihilate the reentry. See MPG video supplemental material66 demonstrating the annihilation of the reentry observed in the hybrid circuit model. In both Figs. 91(c) and 92(c), the stimulus was applied at the excitable gap located far behind the wave-tail of the original reentry, inducing two propagating action potentials in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. The wave propagating in the clockwise direction collided with the original reentrant wave, and they were annihilated with each other. The wave traveling in the counterclockwise direction persisted, leading to the resetting of the reentrant circulation rhythm, where the successive occurrence times of excitation at every compartment were advanced about 50 ms in comparison with the expected times for the original reentry excitation. These three cases are typical responses of the reentry.

The resetting (advance and delay of the circulation rhythm of the reentrant wave) and the annihilation of the reentry can be analyzed using the phase resetting curve (PRC) as performed in the previous studies55,56 in both hybrid and LR-I ring cable models. To this end, the phase of the reentrant wave is defined based on the time instant when the reentrant action potential is detected at a given recording site. Here, we located a recording site the same as the stimulation site, i.e., the compartment number i?=?18. First, the stimulation phase É” that takes a value between 0 and 1 is defined as
É”=tstimT?,
(8) 
where T? is the period of the steady state reentry with no stimulations, and tstim is the time elapsed from the time instant when the last propagating reentrant action potential is detected at the recording site before the stimulation is applied. A small stimulation phase roughly between 0?<?É”?<?0.45, corresponding to roughly 0?<?tstim?<?75 ms, implies that the stimulation is applied when the stimulation site is in the middle of the reentrant action potential. A stimulation phase close to 1, corresponding to tstim~T?, implies that the stimulation is applied close to an oncoming wave-front of the reentry excitation.
The amount of phase reset É¢É” in response to a stimulation with its phase É” is defined as
É¢É”=É¢TT?,
(9) 
where É¢T is the difference between the expected time instant of detecting the original reentrant action potential (when no stimulation is applied) and the time instant of detecting the reentrant action potential that is affected or newly generated by the stimulation. Positive and negative É¢T corresponds to phase delay and advance, respectively.
The result of detailed examinations on the responses of the reentry to stimulations delivered at various phases can be summarized using PRC. Figure 10 shows the PRC of the hybrid cable model (a) and that of the LR-I cable model. In both cases, the phase resetting was largely negative (advanced) when the stimulation phase is in the latter half of the reentry cycle. Only small amount of the phase resetting could be found for the stimulation phase between 0.1 and 0.45. When a stimulation is applied around the middle of the cycle length, roughly 0.47?<?É”?<?0.56 for the hybrid cable model and roughly 0.42?<?É”?<?0.51 for the LR-I cable model as depicted by vertical gray bands in Figs. 10(a) and 10(b), the reentry is annihilated by the stimulation as shown in Figs. 91(b) and 92(b). The phase interval corresponding to this gray band is referred to as the annihilation phase interval. Note that the PRC of the hybrid ring cable model in Fig. 10(a) was obtained by averaging three PRCs because the amount of resetting for a given stimulation phase could vary for every trial, possibly due to internal noises contaminated in the hardware circuits and small differences in the parameter values of every analog device. Moreover, for the hybrid cable model, the amount of phase reset at É”?=?1 was not exactly the same as that at É”?=?0. The difference was about 7 ms, and it was also due to the random fluctuation of the reentry period in the hybrid cable. Aside from this random nature in the hybrid model, the similarity between Figs. 10(a) and 10(b) is satisfactory.

Each error bar in (a) represents the standard deviation of the averaged three resetting values for three stimulations applied at the corresponding phase. (b) PRC of the LR-I ring cable model. Negative É¢É” implies phase advance. The vertical gray band represents the annihilation phase interval. That is, the reentry is annihilated if a stimulation falls within this interval.
 
Once we obtain the PRC representing the response of the reentrant wave to single stimulations at various stimulation phases, we should be able to predict the dynamics of the reentry in response to a periodic sequence of the stimulations as examined in the previous study.56 Let us consider the response of the reentry to a sequence of the stimulations with period Tstim. According to the theory of PRC, for a given phase of the first stimulation É”1, the second stimulation is applied at the phase É”2=É”1?É¢É”1+Tstim/T? (mod 1). In general, for a given nth stimulation phase, the (n?+?1)th stimulation phase can be described as follows:
É”n+1=É”n?É¢É”n+TstimT?,(mod1).
(10) 
Using this iterative mapping formulation, we can obtain a sequence of stimulation phases {É”n} for a given initial stimulation phase É”1. If É”n falls within the annihilation phase interval for the first time along the sequence, we can predict that the reentry is annihilated by the nth stimulation of the periodic train of the stimulations with period Tstim.
We examined whether this theory could predict the reentry dynamics in the hybrid cable model and the LR-I cable model. For each of these two cable models, we used the PRC obtained in Fig. 10 to establish the iterative mapping as in Eq. (10). As an example, we set Tstim?=?185 ms and É”1?=?0.6875 for the hybrid cable model. Equation (10) with the PRC shown in Fig. 10(a) predicts that the first stimulation induces a relatively large delay É¢É”1????0.38, followed by É”2?=?É”1 ?É¢É”1?+?1.25 (mod 1)?=?0.3193, and É”3 =É”2 ? É¢É”2?+?1.25 (mod 1)?=?0.5693 which is within the annihilation interval. Figure 11 shows the dynamics of the hybrid ring cable model in response to this set of stimulations. The results confirm the prediction of the theory. That is, two stimulations separated by Tstim?=?185 ms could not annihilate the reentry as in Fig. 111(a), but three did as in Fig. 111(b).

(1a) and (1b) Reentry in the hybrid cable model was annihilated by three stimulations equally separated by Tstim?=?185 ms in (1b) but not by two stimulations in (1a). (2a) and (2b) Reentry in the LR-I cable model was annihilated by three stimulations equally separated by Tstim?=?200 ms in (2b) but not by two stimulations in (2a).
 
Another example performed for the LR-I ring cable used the stimulations with Tstim?=?200 and É”1?=?0.8182. As in the hybrid cable model, Eq. (10) with the PRC of Fig. 10(b) for the LR-I cable predicts that É”3?=?0.4732 falls within the annihilation phase interval, and Figs. 112(a) and 112(b) confirmed this prediction. Quantitative similarity between Figs. 111(a), 111(b) and 112(a), 112(b) was satisfactory again, confirming a capability of reproducing the LR-I cable dynamics by the hybrid cable model. However, the similarity was not so much enough as we could predict LR-I dynamics using the PRC obtained from the phase resetting experiments in the hybrid cable model.
 
V. DISCUSSIONGO TO SECTION...
 
In this article, we showed that the proposed analog-digital hybrid circuit models of a single cell (hybrid cell model) and spatially distributed cable (hybrid cable model) were capable of reproducing action potential generation as well as the conduction of action potentials in the LR-I models of a cardiac ventricular cell and its one-dimensional cable. Good correspondence between the hybrid cable model and LR-I cable model was demonstrated using a one dimensional active cable as a model of anatomical reentry in a cardiac tissue with various conditions. Those include (1) unidirectional block to initiate reentry, (2) phase resetting by single impulsive stimulations, (3) annihilation of the reentry by appropriately timed single stimulations, (4) PRCs that can characterize the reentry dynamics in response to single stimulations at various timings, and (5) sequential phase resettings that leads to annihilation of the reentry as predicted by the one dimensional discrete Poincare mappings.
Overall correspondence between the hybrid model and LR-I model was satisfactory. However, if we looked carefully at the action potential waveform in the single isolated hybrid cell model, it was different from one in the LR-I model for the interval right after the phase 0 upstroke as in Fig. 6. In particular, the initial phase 1 repolarization in the hybrid model was more pronounced. This was due to poor reproduction in the fast sodium current INa by the analog circuit. This is because INa is time-dependent with the time- dependent transient I-V relationship. As shown in the supplemental material,66 the inward current response of the analog INa to the voltage clamp was smaller in amplitude and slower in decay for most of the clamp voltages. As a possible handling, we tried to equalize net amount of the current inflow as much as possible. The small amplitude INa influx caused the pronounced repolarization at the phase 1. The poor reproduction of INa also induced the difference in the action potential waveform between the hybrid and LR-I models when we modified Isi dynamics as shown in Fig. 7, in which APD of the hybrid cell model was about 1.5 times longer than that of the LR-I model. This might be due to the slow decay of INa at the voltage around 0 mV. That is, the long lasting INa held back the repolarization even when Isi was decreased by the modification. A better reproduction of the transient I-V relationship for INa with other combinations of analog devices can improve agreement between the hybrid model and the LR-I model. Although we have tried to implement INa in the dsPIC, there was insufficient memory space in the dsPIC.

Panels (a) and (b) represent the action potential waveforms generated by the LR-I model and the analog-digital hybrid cell model, respectively, in response to a single current pulse. Panel (c) shows the action potential waveform in the hybrid cell model after the scale conversion.
 
The hybrid cable model was able to perform real-time simulations of excitation propagation in cardiac tissues. It should be noted that, since each of single hybrid cell models always operates real-time and interact with neighboring hybrid cell models just through analog resistors, the real-time capability of the tissue circuit is completely independent of the number of the cell models and even topology of the connections between the cell models. In this study, we used a PC with Intel(R) Core(TM) 2 Quad CPU Q9550 2.83 GHz and 3.25 GB RAM. For the numerical simulation of LR-I cable with 80 compartments, it took about 20 s for 200 ms simulation time span that was roughly equal to one cycle length of the reentry. Of course it took just 200 ms for simulating 200 ms in the hybrid cable model. This is the meaning of the real-time capability in this study. That is, the hybrid model can interact electrically with real world cardiac cells if necessary. Although no optimization algorithms were introduced into the C or C++ source code program used for simulating the LR-I cable dynamics, the hybrid cable model was able to realize simulations over 100 times faster than those required for the numerical simulations of the LR-I cable model. Sophisticated techniques as well as HPC technology can speed the numerical simulation so that the speed ratio could be smaller than 100 obtained in this study. However, it will take a long time for numerical simulations of large scale cardiac tissues to catch up with real-time performance.
From the satisfactory correspondences that we examined here between the hybrid and LR-I cable models, and taking into account the real-time simulation capability of the hybrid model, we could conclude that the hybrid model might be a useful tool for large scale simulations of cardiac tissue dynamics, as an alternative to numerical simulations, leading toward further understanding of the reentrant mechanisms.
How can a cardiac tissue model with the hybrid cell models be large scale? Each analog-digital hybrid cell model used in this study was powered with Å}9 V, and the peak total current measured at the dc power sources V+ and V? of Fig. 3 for the analog part of the model was 0.08 A and ?0.06 A, respectively. For the digital part with 5 V dc power source (VCC) of Fig. 5, it was 0.14 A. Simple calculations give us a rough estimation of the energy consumption in a single hybrid cell model, and it is about 2 W at most. For the hybrid cable model with N cell models, this becomes 2N W. The energy consumption of the hybrid cable model with N?=?80 is thus about 160 W, which is roughly comparable order with an energy consumption single desktop PC. This estimation implies that a large quantity of energy might be consumed for large scale real-time dynamics simulations. As the mission of the current study was to perform real-time simulations of excitation propagation, we were not concerned with the issue of minimizing the power consumption in the circuits. One way to achieve reduction in the energy consumption, and also reduction in the physical size of the circuit, is to implement this analog-digital hybrid circuit using LSI technology. Indeed, development of technology begins to allow for such realizations as attempted in some recent studies.63,64 Therefore, if the proposed hybrid cell model can be implemented as a LSI circuit in the future, dynamics of a large scale aggregation of the hybrid cell models as a cardiac tissue model can be simulated in real-time with a smaller energy consumption, where we would be able to address more complex dynamics of the heart tissue as a large scale excitable medium than the one exhibited by one dimensional tissue and control of them, such as spiral wave propagations, break-up of spiral waves, and defibrillation of them.10,28,35,47,65

APPENDIX: GLOSSARY OF CIRCUIT DIAGRAMS
Figure 12 shows nine circuit diagrams of the voltage sources (V1-V9) for generating the Nernst potentials and others of ion channel currents in the analog part shown in Fig. 4. Basically, general-purpose 6 V regulators (7806) are used to fix the voltage signal of V+ to 6 V and capacitors are applied for smoothing the electrical signal. In some of the circuits, the voltage signal of 6 V is divided by voltage-dividing circuits which consist of resistors as shown in the figure. Then, voltage followers which are constructed by using a general-purpose operational amplifier, LF356N, are applied to reinforce the current signal with the value of V1, V2, V3,V4, V5, V6, V7, V8, and V9 as 1.3 V, 1.2 V, 6 V, 1.52 V, 2.3 V, 6 V, 1 V, 3 V, and 3.6 V, respectively.
