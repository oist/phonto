SECTION IINTRODUCTION
To understand how the brain works, we need to combine experimental studies of animal and human nervous systems with numerical simulation of large-scale brain models. As we develop such large-scale brain models consisting of spiking neurons, we must find compromises between two seemingly mutually exclusive requirements: The model for a single neuron must be: 1) computationally simple, yet 2) capable of producing rich firing patterns exhibited by real biological neurons. Using biophysically accurate Hodgkin?Huxley-type models is computationally prohibitive, since we can simulate only a handful of neurons in real time. In contrast, using an integrate-and-fire model is computationally effective, but the model is unrealistically simple and incapable of producing rich spiking and bursting dynamics exhibited by cortical neurons.

In this paper, a simple spiking model (1), (2) is presented that is as biologically plausible as the Hodgkin?Huxley model, yet as computationally efficient as the integrate-and-fire model. Depending on four parameters, the model reproduces spiking and bursting behavior of known types of cortical neurons, as we illustrate in Fig. 1 and summarize in Fig. 2.

Mathematical analysis of the model will be published in the monograph by Izhikevich [8]. The derivation of the first (1) is based on bifurcation theory and normal form reduction [2], [5], and the part Formula is sometimes referred to as being a quadratic integrate-and-fire neuron. The full model was first published in [10, eqns. (4) and (5)] with voltage reset discussed in Sect. 2.3.1 in a trigonometric form more suitable for mathematical analysis. The form presented here is more suitable for large-scale simulations.

SECTION IITHE MODEL
Bifurcation methodologies [8] enable us to reduce many biophysically accurate Hodgkin?Huxley-type neuronal models to a two-dimensional (2-D) system of ordinary differential equations of the form
FormulaTeX Source with the auxiliary after-spike resetting
FormulaTeX Source Here, Formula and Formula are dimensionless variables, and Formula, Formula, Formula, and Formula are dimensionless parameters, and Formula, where Formula is the time. The variable Formula represents the membrane potential of the neuron and Formula represents a membrane recovery variable, which accounts for the activation of Formula ionic currents and inactivation of Formula ionic currents, and it provides negative feedback to Formula. After the spike reaches its apex (+30 mV), the membrane voltage and the recovery variable are reset according to the (3). Synaptic currents or injected dc-currents are delivered via the variable Formula.

The part Formula was obtained by fitting the spike initiation dynamics of a cortical neuron (other choices also feasible) so that the membrane potential Formula has Formula scale and the time Formula has Formula scale. The resting potential in the model is between ?70 and ?60 mV depending on the value of Formula. As most real neurons, the model does not have a fixed threshold; Depending on the history of the membrane potential prior to the spike, the threshold potential can be as low as ?55 mV or as high as ?40 mV.

The parameter Formula describes the time scale of the recovery variable Formula. Smaller values result in slower recovery. A typical value is Formula.
The parameter Formula describes the sensitivity of the recovery variable Formula to the subthreshold fluctuations of the membrane potential Formula. Greater values couple Formula and Formula more strongly resulting in possible subthreshold oscillations and low-threshold spiking dynamics. A typical value is Formula. The case Formula corresponds to saddle-node (Andronov?Hopf) bifurcation of the resting state [10].
The parameter Formula describes the after-spike reset value of the membrane potential Formula caused by the fast high-threshold Formula conductances. A typical value is Formula.
The parameter Formula describes after-spike reset of the recovery variable Formula caused by slow high-threshold Formula and Formula conductances. A typical value is Formula.
Various choices of the parameters result in various intrinsic firing patterns, including those exhibited by the known types of neocortical [1], [3], [4] and thalamic neurons as summarized in Fig. 2. A possible extension of the model (1), (2) is to treat Formula, Formula and Formula as vectors, and use Formula instead of Formula in the voltage (1). This accounts for slow conductances with multiple time scales, but we find such an extension unnecessarily for cortical neurons.

Neocortical neurons in the mammalian brain can be classified into several types according to the pattern of spiking and bursting seen in intracellular recordings. All excitatory cortical cells are divided into the following four classes [1], [3]:

RS (regular spiking) neurons are the most typical neurons in the cortex. When presented with a prolonged stimulus (injected step of dc-current in Fig. 2RS, bottom) the neurons fire a few spikes with short interspike period and then the period increases. This is called the spike frequency adaptation. Increasing the strength of the injected dc-current increases the interspike frequency, though it never becomes too fast because of large spike-afterhyperpolarizations. In the model, this corresponds to Formula (deep voltage reset) and Formula (large after-spike jump of Formula).
IB (intrinsically bursting) neurons fire a stereotypical burst of spikes followed by repetitive single spikes (Fig. 2IB). In the model, this corresponds to Formula (high voltage reset) and Formula (large after-spike jump of Formula). During the initial burst, variable Formula builds up and eventually switches the dynamics from bursting to spiking.
CH (chattering) neurons can fire stereotypical bursts of closely spaced spikes. The inter-burst frequency can be as high as 40 Hz. In the model, this corresponds to Formula (very high voltage reset) and Formula (moderate after-spike jump of Formula).
All inhibitory cortical cells are divided into the following two classes [4]:

FS (fast spiking) neurons can fire periodic trains of action potentials with extremely high frequency practically without any adaptation (slowing down), as one can see in Fig. 2FS. In the model, this corresponds to Formula (fast recovery).
LTS (low-threshold spiking) neurons can also fire high-frequency trains of action potentials (Fig. 2LTS), but with a noticeable spike frequency adaptation. These neurons have low firing thresholds, which is accounted for by Formula in the model. To achieve a better quantitative fit with real LTS neurons, other parameters of the model need to be changed as well.
In addition, our model can easily reproduce behavior of thalamo-cortical neurons, which provide the major input to the cortex

TC (thalamo-cortical) neurons have two firing regimes: When at rest (Formula is around ?60 mV) and then depolarized, they exhibit tonic firing as in Fig. 2TC, left voltage trace. However, if a negative current step is delivered so that the membrane potential is hyperpolarized (Formula is around ?90 mV), the neurons fire a rebound burst of action potentials, as in Fig. 2TC, right voltage trace.
The model can exhibit other interesting types of dynamics.

RZ (resonator) neurons have damped or sustained subthreshold oscillations, as in Fig. 2RZ. They resonate to rhythmic inputs having appropriate frequency (as the resonate-and-fire model [9]). This behavior corresponds to Formula and Formula. Notice that there is a bistability of resting and repetitive spiking states: The neuron can be switched between the states by an appropriately timed brief stimuli.
Dynamics of other neuronal types, including those in brainstem, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and olfactory bulb, can also be described by our model.

Our Ågone-fits-allÅh choice of the function Formula in (1) is justified when large-scale networks of spiking neurons are simulated, as we discuss below. However, if one is interested in the behavior of a single neuron, then other choices of the function are available, and sometimes more preferable. For example, the function Formula with Formula is a better choice for the RS neuron, since it leads to the saddle-node on invariant circle bifurcation and Class 1 excitability [10].

SECTION IVPULSE-COUPLED IMPLEMENTATION
We have used this model to simulate a sparse network of 10?000 spiking cortical neurons with 1?000?000 synaptic connections in real time (resolution 1 ms) using a 1 GHz desktop PC and C++ programming language. The following MATLAB program (also available on author's webpage) simulates a network of randomly connected 1000 neurons in real time. Motivated by the anatomy of a mammalian cortex, we choose the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory neurons to be 4 to 1, and we make inhibitory synaptic connections stronger. Besides the synaptic input, each neuron receives a noisy thalamic input.

In principle, one can use RS cells to model all excitatory neurons and FS cells to model all inhibitory neurons. The best way to achieve heterogeneity (so that different neurons have different dynamics), is to assign each excitatory cell Formula and Formula, where Formula is a random variable uniformly distributed on the interval [0,1], and Formula is the neuron index. Thus, Formula corresponds to regular spiking (RS) cell, and Formula corresponds to the chattering (CH) cell. We use Formula to bias the distribution toward RS cells. Similarly, each inhibitory cell has Formula and Formula.

The model belongs to the class of pulse-coupled neural networks (PCNN): The synaptic connection weights between the neurons are given by the matrix Formula, so that firing of the Formulath neuron instantaneously changes variable Formula by Formula.

Algorithm 1
One can see in Fig. 3 that the network exhibits cortical-like asynchronous dynamics; that is, neurons fire Poisson spike trains with mean firing rates around 8 Hz. Dark vertical lines indicate that there are occasional episodes of synchronized firings in the alpha and gamma frequency range (10 and 40 Hz, respectively). Although the network is connected randomly and there is no synaptic plasticity, the neurons self-organize into assemblies and they exhibit collective rhythmic behavior in the frequency range corresponding to that of the mammalian cortex in the awake state. Changing the relative strength of synaptic connections and the strength of the thalamic drive can produce other types of collective behavior, including spindle waves and sleep oscillations. We can easily observe and study these cortical states because our simple spiking model describes accurately dynamics of known types of cortical neurons. Thus, there is no longer a contradiction between biological plausibility and computational efficiency of model neural networks.

SECTION VCONCLUSION
In this paper, a simple model that reproduces the rich behavior of biological neurons, including spiking, bursting, and mixed mode firing patters, post-inhibitory (rebound) spikes and bursts, continuous spiking with frequency adaptation, spike threshold variability, bistability of resting and spiking states, and subthreshold oscillations and resonance is presented (the latter are discussed in [7] and [9]).

Our model is the simplest possible model that can reproduce these types of neuronal behavior: It consists of only two equations and has only one nonlinear term, i.e., Formula. Yet, the model is canonical in the sense that the difference between it and a whole class of biophysically detailed and accurate Hodgkin?Huxley-type models, including those consisting of enormous number of equations and taking into account all possible information about ionic currents, is just a matter of coordinate change [6].

We show how to use the model to build networks of spiking neurons capable of exhibiting collective dynamics and rhythms similar to those of the mammalian cortex. Due to the extreme computational simplicity of the model, we can simulate thalamo-cortical networks consisting of tens of thousands of spiking neurons in real time with 1 ms resolution using an old 1-GHz desktop PC.
