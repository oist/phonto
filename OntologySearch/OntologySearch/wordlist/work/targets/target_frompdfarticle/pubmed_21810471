Background. KCNQ1 gene encodes the delayed rectiﬁer K+ channel in cardiac muscle, and its mutations cause
long QT syndrome type 1 (LQT1). Especially exercise-related cardiac events predominate in LQT1. We
previously reported that a KCNQ1 splicing mutation displays LQT1 phenotypes. Methods and results. We
identiﬁed novel mutation at the third base of intron 7 (IVS7 +3A NG) in exercise-induced LQT1 patients.
Minigene assay in COS7 cells and RT-PCR analysis of patients' lymphocytes demonstrated the presence of exon
7-deﬁcient mRNA in IVS7 +3A N G, as well as c.1032G NA, but not in c.1022C N T. Real-time RT-PCR
demonstrated that both IVS7 +3A N G and c.1032G N A carrier expressed signiﬁcant amounts of exon-skipping
mRNAs (18.8% and 44.8% of total KCNQ1 mRNA). Current recordings from Xenopus oocytes injected cRNA by
simulating its ratios of exon skipping displayed a signiﬁcant reduction in currents to 64.8 ± 4.5% for IVS7 +
3A NG and to 41.4 ± 9.5% for c.1032G N A carrier, respectively, compared to the condition without splicing error.
Computer simulation incorporating these quantitative results revealed the pronounced QT prolongation under
beta-adrenergic stimulation in IVS7 +3A N G carrier model. Conclusion. Here we report a novel splicing
mutation IVS7 +3A NG, identiﬁed in a family with mild form LQT1 phenotypes, and examined functional
outcome in comparison with three other variants around the exon 7–intron 7 junction. In addition to
c.1032G N A mutation, IVS7 +3A N G generates exon-skipping mRNAs, and thereby causing LQT1 phenotype.
The severity of clinical phenotypes appeared to differ between the two splicing-related mutations and to result
from the amount of resultant mRNAs and their functional consequences.

1. Introduction

Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is characterized by prolongation of the
cardiac action potential, syncopal attacks, torsades de pointes arrhyth-
mias and sudden cardiac death [1–3]. The slow component of delayed
rectiﬁer K+ current (IKs) in the heart modulates repolarization of cardiac
action potential. The IKs channel is formed by the co-assembly of KCNQ1
α-subunits and KCNE1 β-subunits [4,5]. Mutations in the KCNQ1 cause
the most frequent form of inherited LQT1 [6]. Exercise-related cardiac
events dominate the clinical picture of LQT1 patients.

Pre-mRNA processing is an important aspect of gene expression
and consists of the precise recognition of exons and removal of introns
in such a way that the exons are joined to form mature mRNAs with
intact translational reading frames [7,8]. Disruption of normal splicing
as a result of genetic mutation can lead to the generation of abnormal

proteins or the degradation of aberrant transcripts through nonsense-
mediated decay, and thus to the pathogenesis of a variety of human
diseases [9].

We previously reported three LQTS families, in whom a G to A
change in the last base of KCNQ1 exon 7 (c.1032G NA) was identiﬁed
[10]. The mutation alters the 5′ splice-site of intron 7, resulting in the
production of exon-skipping transcripts, but not to alter the coded
alanine (A344A) [11,12], since it involves the characteristic consensus
sequence of the splicing donor site, AG/GUAAGU. The vicinity of junction
around the KCNQ1 exon 7–intron 7 appeared to be a hot area for genetic
variants that may potentially cause aberrant splicing, and we identiﬁed
a novel mutation that changes an A to G at the third base of intron 7
(IVS7 +3ANG) in LQTS family with mild clinical phenotypes. In con-
trast, another neighboring KCNQ1 mutation, c.1022C NT (p. A341V) is
known to produce severe clinical phenotypes [13].

To test the potential inﬂuence of these mutations that may affect the
KCNQ1 splicing, we established a minigene assay system in which a
respective mutant construct is transcribed in COS7 cells and examined
the genetic and biophysical characterization of the novel IVS7 +3ANG

mutation. For comparison, we also investigated two other mutations
around the exon 7–intron 7 junction; c.1022C NT and c.1032GNA. We
quantitatively analyzed the aberrant splicing and its functional con-
sequences and then carried out a computer simulation to explore how
this mutation could be associated with exercise-induced QT prolonga-
tion and tachyarrhythmias.

based on the Ct values and normalized by the GAPDH level of each
sample. The amounts of mutant cDNA were expressed as a percent-
age of the total KCNQ1 mRNA, for which exons 9 through 10 were
ampliﬁed with the exon 9-F forward primer (5′-CGCATGGAGGTGC-
TATGCT-3′) and the exon 10-R reverse primer.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Genomic DNA isolation and mutation analysis

Mutation analysis was carried out as previously described [10].
Genomic DNA was prepared from peripheral blood leukocytes. Sixteen
exons of the KCNQ1 gene were ampliﬁed by PCR. Genetic screening was
performed for KCNQ1 by denaturing high-performance liquid chroma-
tography (DHPLC) using a WAVE System Model 3500 (Transgenomic:
Omaha, NE). We optimized the running optimum temperature at
64.6 °C. Abnormal conformers were ampliﬁed by PCR and sequencing
was performed on an ABI PRISM3130 DNA sequencer (Applied
Biosystems: Foster City, CA). We also carried out a complete screening
for other LQTS-causing genes; KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, KCNE2, and
KCNJ2.

2.2. Construction of splicing minigene and transfection

Exon 7 of the KCNQ1 gene (111 bps) and its ﬂanking introns
(507 bps at 5′ arm and 453 bps at 3′ arm) were ampliﬁed by PCR using
genomic DNA from control and patients. PCR fragments were cloned
into the pSPL3 exon trapping vector (Gibco BRL) digested with EcoRV
within the multiple cloning site. The pSPL3 vector contains the HIV-1
tat exons and the intervening intron with EcoRV site. COS7, CHO and
HL-1cells were transfected with 0.25 μg plasmid DNA using Lipofecta-
min transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 48 h post-
transfection.

2.3. RNA extraction and RT-PCR

Total cellular RNA was isolated with QIAamp RNA Blood Mini Kits
(Qiagen). Subsequently, total RNA was reverse-transcribed by use of the
SuperScriptIII FirstStrand Synthesis System (Invitrogen: Carlsbad, CA),
and was used as a template for subsequent PCR reactions. We used the
forward primer (5′-TCTGAGTCACCTGGACAACC-3′) and the reverse
primer (5′-ATCTCAGTGGTATTTGTGAGC-3′), both of which anneal to
the pSPL3 vector sequence.

Total RNA was extracted from leukocytes of fresh blood and was
reverse-transcribed using the same methods described above. Using
the cDNAs as templates, PCR ampliﬁcation was performed with the
exon 5-F forward primer (5′-GGGCATCCGCTTCCTGCAGA-3′) and the
exon10-R reverse primer (5′-CCATTGTCTTTGTCCAGCTTGAAC-3′) to
amplify KCNQ1 cDNA from exons 5 through 10.

Measurements of normal and mutant mRNA levels were performed by
real-time RT-PCR by use of an ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection
System (Applied Biosystems). The reaction mixture contained SYBR Green
PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), cDNA template, and PCR primers.
In order to selectively amplify these splicing variants, PCR primers were
designed so that they spanned the adjacent exons: exon 6.8-F: 5′-
CTGTGGTGGGGGGTG-GGGATT-3′, exon 6.9-F: 5′-TGTGGTGGGGGGTG-
ACCGCAT-3′, and exon 7.9-F: 5′-CTTTGCGCTCCCAGCG-ACCG-3′ (all
the hyphens inside the primer sequence indicate the boundaries of
exons). In all cases, the dissociation curves showed that there was no
signiﬁcant contribution of relatively short by-products to the measured
ﬂuorescence intensities.

All the samples were tested in duplicate. A standard curve for each
primer pair was obtained using serial dilutions of a recombinant
plasmid containing cDNA. The threshold cycle (Ct) was subsequently
determined. Relative mRNA levels of splice mutants were calculated

2.4. Oocyte isolation and electrophysiology

Xenopus laevis oocytes were prepared and current recordings were
carried out as described previously [14]. Wild-type (WT) cRNA plus
mutant-cRNA (total 10 ng) was injected into Xenopus oocytes. All the
current recordings in the present study were performed in the presence
of KCNE1 β-subunits (1 ng). An axoclamp-2B ampliﬁer (Axon In-
struments: Union City, CA) was used to record currents at 25 °C in
oocytes 3–4 days after cRNA injection, using standard two-electrode
voltage-clamp techniques. To decrease the interference from endoge-
nous Cl− current, we used a low-Cl− bath solution (mM): NaOH 96,
KOH 2, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1, MeS 101, HEPES 5 (pH titrated to 7.6 with
methanesulfonic acid). Currents were sampled at 10 kHz and ﬁltered
at 2 kHz. Voltage steps were applied with 3-second pulses in 10 mV
increments from a holding potential of −80 mV to voltages from −70
to +30 mV, and then to−30 mV. Current amplitudes were measured at
1.8-second after the initiation of 3-second pulse applied to a +30 mV
test potential, followed by the subtraction of background IKs current
(22.9 nA).

2.5. Computer simulation

We conducted simulations of paced propagation in a one-
dimensional (1D) bidomain myocardial model of 9.0-mm length
with transverse conductivity, mimicking transmural section of left
ventricular free wall. Membrane kinetics was represented by the
Priebe–Beuckelmann model [15], which can simulate human ventric-
ular action potentials.

To obtain the ventricular transmural gradient, we deﬁned endocar-
dial, mid-myocardial, and epicardial tissues of lengths (thicknesses)
0.6 mm, 6.0 mm, and 2.4 mm, respectively, and then we incorporated
modiﬁcations of ion channel conductance (Table 1), based on the
previous studies [16,17]. Pacing stimuli of 3-ms duration and strength
twice-diastolic threshold were applied transmembranously to the
endocardial end at a cycle length of 1000 ms. To get ECG similar to the
left precordial ECG, a unipolar recording electrode was located 3 cm
above the epicardial end of the tissue. Other model parameters, such
as the tissue conductivities and the boundary conditions, can be found
elsewhere [18,19].

To achieve the beta-adrenergic stimulation, we set the param-
eters as previously described [20–22]: (1) shifting the fast and slow
inactivation curves of the sodium current (INa) –3.4 mV, (2) increasing
the L-type calcium current (ICaL) 3 times and slowing the time constant
of inactivation 1.13 times, (3) increasing the half-point concentration
for the calcium-dependent inactivation (fCa) from 0.7 to 0.9 μM, and
setting its non-zero minimum value to 0.03, (4) increasing the slowly

times and shifting the activation curve −8 mV, and (5) increasing
currents of the calcium pump in sarcoplasmic reticulum (Iup) and the
sodium–potassium pump (INaK) 1.41 and 1.2 times, respectively.

The numerical approach, including methods for integration and
solution of the linear system, has been described elsewhere [18]. The
time and spatial discretization steps were 10 μs and 75 μm, respec-
tively. The method for calculating ECG was also described previously
[23]. QT interval was numerically deﬁned as the time period from the
onset of Q wave to the last peak of second derivative of T wave. The
convergence of the simulation results was tested by repeating some
simulations with half of the spatial and time discretization steps.

2.6. Statistical analysis

Quantitative data are presented as the mean±SEM. Multiple
comparisons among groups were carried out by one-way ANOVA with
Bonferroni's least signiﬁcant difference as the post-hoc test. A level of
P b0.05 was accepted as statistically signiﬁcant.

3. Results

3.1. Clinical phenotypes

Pedigree for the family with novel IVS7 +3A NG mutation is shown
in Fig. 1a. The proband, 34-year-old woman (II-1), was ﬁrst diagnosed
with LQTS at age 14, and has remained asymptomatic. The ECG
recording at rest showed a marked QT prolongation (QTc=558 ms:
Fig. 1b). Her mother (I-2) had no syncopal episodes, despite a re-
markable QT prolongation at rest (QTc=536 ms: Fig. 1b, I-2). Her father
(I-1) had normal QTc interval (QTc=367 ms: Fig. 1b, I-1). None of her
relatives have had a history of syncope or cardiac sudden death.
Treadmill test of the proband revealed a pronounced exercise-induced
QT prolongation (QTc=503 ms before exercise, 615 ms at stage 4:
Fig. 1c).

Regarding the families with c.1032G NA mutation, there were 9
probands from 9 unrelated families. Eight of them (89%) were symp-
tomatic, and seven (78%) developed cardiac events before age 15. Their
episodes were triggered by exercise, especially swimming (ﬁve cases).
Seven of 9 families (78%) had at least N2 symptomatic mutation carriers.

Mean QTc interval of 9 probands were 494±90 ms. Although there is
only one family with IVS7 +3A NG mutation, clinical features were
apparently severer in families with c.1032GNA mutation.

3.2. Mutation analysis

DNA samples from 3 members of the family were subjected to a
mutation screening of the KCNQ1 gene. An abnormal migration
pattern was identiﬁed by DHPLC analysis (Fig. 2a; note the greater
height of the left peak in II-1 and I-2 as indicated by the arrows) in
KCNQ1 exon 7 of the 2 affected individuals. The control sample and
the father (I-1) showed a normal pattern, as indicated by the com-
parable height of the left and right peaks (Fig. 2a). DNA sequencing
identiﬁed a heterozygous adenine to guanine transition in KCNQ1 at
nucleotide IVS7+3 (IVS7 +3A NG) (Fig. 2b right panel), which
located in the 5′ splice-site of intron 7. Fig. 2b left panel shows a
schematic structure of KCNQ1 channel subunit. The exon 7 spans from
part of the P-loop to part of the S6 region (indicated by red color).

3.3. Screening of KCNQ1 splicing mutation using minigene assay

Minigene assay was performed in COS7 cells to assess the effect
of the IVS7 +3A NG mutation on the splicing of KCNQ1 exon 7. Fig. 3a
shows the construct of minigene harboring KCNQ1 exon 7 and its
ﬂanking introns inserted into the pSPL3 vector. We also tested 3
other neighboring mutations that may affect the splicing of exon 7
(c.1022C NT, c.1032G NA, IVS7 +28T NC). c.1032G NA was used as a
positive control that we and others reported to cause skipping of
exon 7 [10,12].

The control KCNQ1 minigene expression in COS7 cells resulted in a
production of the single mRNA band that corresponds to KCNQ1 exon
7 joined to the vector exons (Fig. 3b). The mutant minigene containing
c.1022C NT or IVS7 +28T NC also showed the same single mRNA,
indicating these mutations do not cause aberrant splicing (Fig. 3b).
However, the mutant minigene containing IVS7 +3A NG, as well as the
positive control c.1032G NA, generated 2 major mRNA bands that
correspond to the normal transcript and a shorter transcript lacking
KCNQ1 exon 7 respectively (Fig. 3b). The expression level of the
shorter mRNA band appeared to be greater in c.1032G NA compared
with IVS7 +3A NG. No band was detected in the RNA sample without
reverse-transcriptase. We conﬁrmed similar results both in CHO and
HL-1cells under the same experimental conditions (data not shown).

(Fig. 4a), using primers spanning exons 5 through 10. Samples from
individuals having IVS7 +3A NG and c.1032G NA showed shorter
bands as well as the normal-sized WT. The direct sequencing of these
short-sized transcripts revealed the existence of three kinds of exon-
skipping mRNAs as indicated to the right of panel 4a (Δ7-8:399 bp,
Δ7: 495 bp, Δ8: 510 bp, WT: 606 bp). Nucleotide sequence of each
of the exon-skipping mRNAs is also shown. Control, c.1022C NT and
IVS7 +28T NC showed normal patterns; the predominant WT and a
small portion of Δ8.

3.5. Quantiﬁcation of exon-skipping KCNQ1 mRNAs using real-time RT-PCR

We carried out quantitative analysis of short-sized mutant mRNAs
in affected patients carrying the IVS7 +3A NG or c.1032G NA mutation,
using real-time RT-PCR. Normal individuals had minor fractions of
splicing variants (WT: 93.0±0.7%, Δ7: 0.0±0.0%, Δ7-8: 0.1±0.0%, Δ8:
6.9±0.7%, of total KCNQ1 transcripts; n=4) as shown in the left bar
graph of Fig. 4b. In contrast to c.1032GNA carriers who displayed a
distinct exon skipping (WT: 55.2±0.9%, Δ7: 23.5±1.7%, Δ7-8: 16.8±
0.9%, Δ8: 4.5±0.7%; n=3, right bar graph in panel 4b), IVS7 +3ANG
carrier showed modest but signiﬁcant amount of exon skipping (WT:
81.2%, Δ7: 9.7%, Δ7-8: 5.7%, Δ8: 3.4%; n=1, middle bar graph).

3.6. Biophysical characteristics of exon-skipping KCNQ1 proteins

Previously, we performed biophysical characterization of mutant
KCNQ1 proteins (Δ7, Δ7-8, and Δ8) in X. laevis oocytes injected with
mutant cRNAs. We demonstrated the Xenopus oocytes injected with Δ7,
Δ7-8, or Δ8 alone displayed no time-dependent currents, indicating
these mutants were non-functional. Furthermore, each exon-skipping
KCNQ1 protein had the mutant-speciﬁc level of dominant-negative
effect on WT channels [10].

In order to simulate the electrophysiological properties of cardiac
cells of the affected patients, we injected the cRNAs (total 10 ng) with
the relative ratios of WT and mutant KCNQ1 inferred from the data
obtained in the real-time RT-PCR experiment (Fig. 4b). Oocytes injected
at cRNA ratios comparable to those evaluated in IVS7 +3A NG showed
remarkable reduction in currents compared with those of normal indi-
viduals, but less pronounced than c.1032G NA carriers; 100±14.5%
(n=6) for control, 64.8±4.5% (n=7) for IVS7 +3A NG carriers
(pb0.05), 41.4±9.5% (n=6) for c.1032GNA carriers (pb0.05) (Fig. 5).

3.4. Identiﬁcation of exon-skipping KCNQ1 mRNAs in patient's blood
sample

To directly conﬁrm the minigene assay results, total RNA samples
extracted from the patients' lymphocytes were subjected to RT-PCR

Finally, we performed a computer simulation study employing the
1D myocardial model (Fig. 6a) to explore the cellular mechanisms by
which these splicing mutations manifest QT prolongation under
exercise and induce ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

myocardial, and epicardial tissues of the 1D model during pacing at 1 Hz
in the cases of control (black line), IKs 60% as a model of IVS7 +3ANG
carrier (dark gray line), and IKs 60% with β-adrenergic stimulation as a
model of IVS7 +3A NG carrier under exercise stress (light gray line).
Simulated ECGs in the above 3 cases are also shown in the bottom. In the
model of IVS7 +3ANG carrier, the β-adrenergic stimulation markedly
prolonged the QTc (668 ms) while the IKs 60% alone did not (388 ms vs.
366 ms in control case).

Similar to Fig. 6b, c presents regional action potentials and simulated
ECGs in the cases of control (black line), IKs 40% as a model of c.1032GNA
carrier (dark gray line), and IKs 40% with β-adrenergic stimulation as a
model of c.1032G NA carrier under exercise stress (light gray line). In the
model of c.1032G NA carrier, the β-adrenergic stimulation markedly
prolonged the QTc (741 ms) while the IKs 40% alone did not (405 ms).
Fig. 6d and e show regional action potentials and simulated ECGs
for a longer period (21–40 s after the ﬁrst pacing stimulus) in the cases
of IKs 60% (IVS7 +3A NG carrier) with β-adrenergic stimulation and IKs
40% (c.1032G NA carrier) with β-adrenergic stimulation, respectively.
Intriguingly, no arrhythmia was induced for IVS7 +3A NG carrier model
(Fig. 6d) whereas tachyarrhythmia was induced for c.1032GNA carrier
model (Fig. 6e). In the latter, the monomorphic ventricular tachycardia
(VT) was initially derived from triggered activities due to delayed
afterdepolarization (asterisks) in the epicardial region. The VT soon
degenerated into the ﬁbrillation-like activities (VF) because of marked
long APD in the mid-myocardial region, causing decremental conduc-
tion (†, endocardial to mid-myocardial regions) followed by propagated
graded response (mid-myocardial to endocardial regions) and phase-2
reentry (‡, epicardial activation originating from action potential
plateau in the mid-myocardial region).

of KCNQ1 identiﬁed in clinically-diagnosed LQTS patients were studied.
First, we assessed the effects exerted by these mutations on splicing of
the KCNQ1 transcript using a hybrid minigene in transient transfection
experiments, and found that c.1032GNA and IVS7 +3ANG resulted in
the skipping of KCNQ1 exon 7 (Fig. 3). In good agreement with the
minigene assay results, we conﬁrmed the presence of exon-skipping
transcripts in the blood samples of the mutation carriers (Fig. 4a). The
minigene assay is a useful tool to screen for potential splicing mutations
in clinically-diagnosed LQTS patients with no mutation in the KCNQ1
coding sequence.

4.2. Mechanistic basis of splicing abnormality

Splice sites are conserved sequences at both ends of an intron that
are recognized during the initial steps of splicing [24]. Mutations at 5′
splice-site are frequent among mutations that cause human diseases
[25,26]. The human 5′ splice-site consensus sequence is MAG/GTRAGT
(M is A or C; R is A or G), spanning from position −3 to position +6
relative to the exon–intron junction. A (59%) and G (35%) are conserved
at position +3 [27], but it has been shown that 5′ splice-site with
disease-causing +3ANG mutations are frequently associated with non-
consensus nucleotides at positions +4 and +5 [28]. Indeed, the KCNQ1
intron7 5′ splice-site sequence, GCG/GTAGGT, has non-consensus G
at position +4, which presumably facilitates the skipping of exon
under +3ANG mutation. These dependencies between +3 (A/G)
and +4/+5 were demonstrated by other investigators'in in vitro ex-
periment; the splicing defect in the +3ANG mutant was successfully
ﬁxed by converting either +4 or +5 independently to the consensus
[28]. In contrast, G at position-1 is more strictly conserved, and
mutations at this position, as c.1032GNA, cause robust splicing defects
[28]. Hence, these differences in the strength of 5′ splice-site sequence
dictate the extent to which splicing is disrupted, as indicated by the
greater amount of exon-skipped transcripts in c.1032G NA compared
with IVS7 +3ANG (Fig. 4b).

4.3. Signiﬁcance of quantitative assessment of splicing abnormality in
risk stratiﬁcation

The family with IVS7 +3ANG splicing mutation showed mild LQTS
phenotype; asymptomatic and had no history of sudden cardiac death,
despite an exercise-induced QT prolongation (Fig. 1). Meanwhile,
c.1032G NA mutation, a similar KCNQ1 splicing mutation, was more
malignant; 8 families out of 9 were symptomatic with episodes of
syncope (mostly during exercise or swimming) or sudden death, as we
previously reported [10]. These observations strongly suggest the
possible correlation between genotypes and clinical phenotypes in
LQTS caused by aberrant splicing of KCNQ1. This profound suppression
in IKs currents may underlie the pathophysiology of these patients.
Moreover, the level of aberrant proteins may parallel the clinical
severity.

We previously showed that the exon-skipping mutant channel
subunits (Δ7, Δ7-8, or Δ8) are non-functional, and they have mutant-
speciﬁc degree of dominant-negative effect on WT channels, by
trapping WT intracellularly and thereby interfering its translocation
to the plasma membrane [10]. On the assumption that as the result of
splicing error the reduction in potassium current would occur in
the mutant carriers with similar degrees evaluated by the real-time
RT-PCR (Fig. 4b), we estimated functional consequences of these
splicing mutation (IVS7 +3A NG and c.1032G NA). Ratios simulating
the proportions of various transcripts of KCNQ1 in affected individuals
resulted in a pronounced reduction in the whole-cell potassium
current in Xenopus oocytes, compared with ratios simulating those in
normal individuals; 64.8% for IVS7 +3A NG, and 41.4% for c.1032G NA
(Fig. 5b).

The computer simulation study (Fig. 6) incorporating these
quantitative results demonstrated the pronounced QT prolonga-
tion under beta-stimulation in both IVS7 +3A NG and c.1032G NA,
and the occurrence of tachyarrhythmias only in c.1032G NA. Our com-
puter model was human ventricular model [15] and the parameters
for beta-stimulation were based on physiological data reported

previously [20–22]. These observations appear to parallel with clinical
phenotypes of the mutation carriers; syncopal episodes mainly during
exercise in c.1032G NA but not IVS7 +3A NG patients, whereas asymp-
tomatic IVS7 +3A NG carriers. Thus, the quantitative assessments of
splicing abnormality could be useful in the risk stratiﬁcation of LQTS
patients associated with KCNQ1 splicing mutations.

4.4. Study limitations

Compared to the clinical data on c.1032G NA, those on IVS7 +3A NG
were gathered from two patients, because we failed to conduct the
genetic test and clinical tests in their remaining relatives. Because of a
relative mildness of their phenotypes, carriers of IVS7 +3ANG mutation
may be less frequently recommended for the genetic test, and this may
partially explain why the number of identiﬁed IVS7 +3ANG family was
small.

4.5. Conclusions

A novel KCNQ1 splicing mutation IVS7 +3A NG generates exon-
skipping mRNAs, and manifests a mild phenotype of LQTS. The amount
of these mRNAs and its functional consequences may determine the
clinical severity of the disease.
