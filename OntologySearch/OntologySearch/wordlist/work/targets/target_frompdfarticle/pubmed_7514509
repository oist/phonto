A Dynamic Model of the Cardiac

Ventricular Action Potential

I. Simulations of Ionic Currents and Concentration Changes

Ching-Hsing Luo, Yoram Rudy

Abstract A mathematical model of the cardiac ventricular
action potential is presented. In our previous work, the
membrane Na+ current and K' currents were formulated. The
present article focuses on processes that regulate intracellular
Ca2' and depend on its concentration. The model presented
here for the mammalian ventricular action potential is based
mostly on the guinea pig ventricular cell. However, it provides
the framework for modeling other types of ventricular cells
with appropriate modifications made to account for species
differences. The following processes are formulated: Ca2+
current through the L-type channel (Ilc), the Na+-Ca2' ex-
changer, Ca2+ release and uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticu-
lum (SR), buffering of Ca2' in the SR and in the myoplasm, a
Ca2' pump in the sarcolemma, the Na+-K+ pump, and a
nonspecific Ca'2-activated membrane current. Activation of
'Ca is an order of magnitude faster than in previous models.

In 1991, we presented the first phase (referred to as
the phase-1 L-R model) of a cardiac action poten-
tial model that was based on recent data from
single-cell and single-channel preparations.1 The earlier
study focused on the depolarization and repolarization
phases of the action potential and on phenomena that
involve interaction between these processes. These in-
cluded supernormal excitability, Wenckebach periodic-
ity, and aperiodic responses of the cell to periodic
stimulation. In terms of membrane ionic channel kinet-
ics, the phase-1 model formulation concentrated on the
fast Na4 current (INa), the time-dependent K+ current
(IK), the time-independent K+ current (IKi), and a
plateau K+ current (IKP). In that model, we introduced
the dependence of the K+ currents on [K+]0. However,
the model did not account for dynamic changes in ionic
concentrations and ionic fluxes during the action poten-
tial. In particular, intracellular Ca2+ transients could not
be simulated because of the following limitations: (1)
Ca24 current through the L-type Ca24 channel (ICa) was
adopted from the model of Beeler and Reuter2 (re-
ferred to as the B-R model). It was not reformulated to
account for recent experimental findings regarding the
channel kinetics, such as fast activation3 and inactiva-
tion that is both voltage and Ca2+ dependent.4-8 (2) The

Inactivation of Ica depends on both the membrane voltage and
[Ca2"],. SR is divided into two subcompartments, a network
SR (NSR) and a junctional SR (JSR). Functionally, Ca2l
enters the NSR and translocates to the JSR following a
monoexponential function. Release of Ca2' occurs at JSR and
can be triggered by two different mechanisms, Ca2'-induced
Ca2+ release and spontaneous release. The model provides the
basis for the study of arrhythmogenic activity of the single
myocyte including afterdepolarizations and triggered activity.
It can simulate cellular responses under different degrees of
Ca2' overload. Such simulations are presented in our accom-
panying article in this issue of Circulation Research. (Circ Res.
1994;74:1071-1096.)

phase-1 model included only ionic currents through
gated channels in the sarcolemma but not other mem-
brane processes (ie, pumps and exchangers) that con-
tribute to changes in ionic concentrations. (3) Intracel-
lular processes that dynamically regulate [Ca"2]i (eg,
Ca24 uptake and release by the sarcoplasmic reticulum
[SR]) were not incorporated in the phase-1 model.

In the phase-2 model presented here, 'Ca is reformu-
lated on the basis of the most recent data from single-
cell and single-channel experiments. Other processes
that regulate the intracellular Ca24 are also incorpo-
rated in the model. These include the following: the
Na+-K+ pump (INaK), the Na4-Ca24 exchanger (INaCa), a
nonspecific Ca24-activated current (Ins(Ca)), a Ca24 pump
in the sarcolemma (1p(Ca)), buffering of Ca24 ions in the
myoplasm and in the SR, uptake of Ca24 (Iup) by the
network SR (NSR), translocation of Ca24 ('te) from the
NSR to junctional SR (JSR), leakage of Ca24 (Ileak) from
NSR, and release of Ca2+ ions ('ret) by the JSR. A
schematic diagram of the model is provided in Fig 1.
The shaded areas indicate the presence of Ca 2+ buffers.
This model can simulate dynamic changes in ionic
concentrations and, in particular, intracellular Ca2+
transients during the action potential. This property of
the model could be the basis for future development of
models of the excitation-contraction coupling process in
cardiac myocytes.

In 1985, DiFrancesco and Noble9 published a model
(D-N model) of the Purkinje action potential that
incorporated many of the processes mentioned above.
As we discussed previously,1 certain properties of ionic
channels were not fully represented in the D-N model
because of the limited data from single-cell and single-

channel experiments at the time. As a result, the D-N
model could not simulate phenomena that were success-
fully simulated with our phase-i model, such as Wenck-
ebach periodicities in response to periodic stimulation.
In addition, the D-N model did not take into account all
processes that participate in the regulation of intracel-
lular Ca'+. One process that was not incorporated in the
D-N model is buffering of Ca2+ by buffers in the
myoplasm. As will be demonstrated by simulations in
this article, this process is essential for a correct simu-
lation of the intracellular Ca2+ transient and related
phenomena. Another dynamic model of a cardiac action
potential was developed for the frog atrial cell by
Rasmusson et al.'0 Although certain aspects of their
model (in particular the kinetics of 'Ca) are similar to
those of the model developed in the present study, other
aspects are very different. A major difference is the lack
of an SR and its role in the dynamics of intracellular
Ca>+ in the Rasmusson model, reflecting the very small
contribution of such processes in frog atrial cells.

In the present study, we provide a detailed descrip-
tion of the development and formulation of the various
components of the model. We test each individual
component by simulating physiological phenomena that
involve this particular component. We then combine the
individual processes into a complete model of the action
potential and investigate the role played by the different
components in generating the action potential. In our
accompanying article in this issue of Circulation Re-
search,"1 we use the model to study phenomena that are
related to the excitation-contraction coupling process
(eg, postextrasystolic mechanical potentiation), to Ca2+-
overload conditions, and to arrhythmogenic activity of
the single cell (eg. early and delayed afterdepolariza-
tions and triggered activity). The model could also
provide the basis for future simulation studies of certain
aspects of ischemia and of various interventions, the
most important being the effects and mechanisms of
action of channel blockers and other antiarrhythmic
drugs.

In addition to the study of mechanisms that deter-
mine the behavior of the single cell, an accurate model
of the action potential is important to simulation studies
of propagation of excitation in cardiac tissue. Our
studies of propagation'2"l3 and of reentry'4 were limited
by the inability to correctly simulate important aspects

of the action potential and situations of physiological
and clinical importance (eg, Ca2' overload and the
effects of Ca'+ channel blockers). The need for a more
complete model of the action potential to further elu-
cidate mechanisms underlying abnormal propagation
(eg, reentrant arrhythmias) provided yet another moti-
vation for the work presented here.

Materials and Methods

General Approach

dV/dt =- (/Cm)(Ii+ Ist)

The general approach is based on a numerical reconstruc-
tion of the ventricular action potential using the following
differential equation that describes the rate of change of
membrane potential (V):
(1)
where Cm is the membrane capacitance, 'St
is a stimulus
current, and Ii is the sum of all ionic currents through the
membrane. In the model developed here, Ii includes ionic
currents through voltage-gated channels and currents carried
by other mechanisms (eg, INaCa and INaK). Gated channels are
described by using Hodgkin-Huxley type formalism.15 This
approach has been described in detail in the first phase of this
work,' in which only gated channels were included in the
model. In the same article,'(p1520) we also discussed the corre-
spondence between the ensemble behavior of ionic channels,
as described by the Hodgkin-Huxley equations, and the single-
channel behavior. The ionic currents are determined by ionic
gates whose gating variables are obtained as a solution to a
coupled system of differential equations. The integration algo-
rithm' for solving the differential equations is based on the
hybrid methods introduced by Rush and Larsen16 and Victorri
et al.17 An adaptive nonlinear least-squares algorithm devel-
oped by Dennis et al18 is used for parameter estimation.

d[B]/dt- (IB * ACap)/(VC * ZB * F)

The model developed here accounts for dynamic changes of
ionic concentrations during the action potential. The rate of
change of ionic concentrations is given by
(2)
where [B] is the concentration of ion B, IB is the sum of ionic
currents carrying ion B, Acap is the capacitive membrane area,
Vc is the volume of the compartment where [B] is updated, ZB
is the valence of ion B, and F is the Faraday constant.
All ionic currents are computed for 1 ,uF of cell membrane
capacitance. Note that currents measured in single cells would
be :'~10 000 times smaller than those reported here. Specific
membrane capacity is set at 1 ,uF/cm2."9 The formulation is
based on experimental data adjusted to 37°C by use of the Q1o
adjustment factor (defined in Appendix 2). For example, if 1Ca
was 2 ,uA/,uF at 22°C with Q1,=3, then lc, at 37°C should be
equal to 2. (Q o)(37-22)10=O10.39 gA/gF. The complete set of
equations for all ionic currents and other processes is provided
in Appendix 1. Geometric parameters and standard ionic
concentrations are also depicted in Appendix 1. Symbols used
in the equations are defined in Appendix 2.

All computer programs were coded in FORTRAN 77 (Mi-
crosoft), and all simulations were implemented (double preci-
sion) on a Macintosh IIcx computer. The integration algorithm
uses an adaptive time step that varies between 1 and 0.01
millisecond, and the potential is updated at steps that range
from 0.2 to 1 mV. A time step <0.01 millisecond is used if the
potential step is >1 mV (details are provided in Luo and
Rudy'). A detailed description of the formulation of the
various components and their integration into the complete
model of the action potential is provided in the following
sections.
Formulation of the Model

been measured by several groups.20-25 On the basis of these

data, the shape of the cell in the model is represented as a
circular cylinder 100 gm in length and 11 ,um in radius. In
ventricular cells, the large degree of membrane folding results
in an actual surface area (represented by Acap) larger than that
calculated from the cylindrical geometry (AGeo). Assuming
specific membrane capacity (CQ) of 1 ,uF/cm2, Isenberg and
Klockner20 found that the ratio (RCG) of Ac,p (defined as
CmICsc) to the geometric membrane area (AGeo) is >2. Values
of RCG measured by other groups21'22'25,26 are also close to, or
smaller than, 2. Therefore, we set RCG=2 in the model.

On the basis of measurements of Ca2+-loading rate, drug
effects, electron micrographs, and the density of its Ca21
content, the SR appears to be functionally and structurally
divided into two compartments: the JSR and the NSR.23,24,27-29
Functionally, Ca21 ions enter the NSR from the myoplasm
through an uptake process; they then translocate from the
NSR into the JSR, where they are released into the myoplasm
following the kinetics of the Ca2+-induced Ca21 release
(CICR) process (Fabiato3-32) or the Ca2+-overload triggering
process.33 On the basis of the measurements of Forbes et a123
and those of other groups,34'35 we set the volume fraction of SR
(FSR) at 6% of the cell volume. The SR volume is divided into
JSR (8%) and NSR (92%). Therefore, FJSR is O.48%=8% . 6%
and FNSR is 5.52%=92% *6% of the cell volume. The mito-
chondria volume fraction (Fmito) is set at 26%.36 The remaining
volume (Fmyo=68%) is occupied by the myoplasm. For consid-
erations of ion accumulation in extracellular clefts, Fcel,: Fcleft is
assumed to be 88%:12%.24,34,35
Standard Ionic Concentrations

The ionic concentrations are the same as those used in our
previous model,' except for [Nat]i, which is decreased from 18
to 10 mmol/L. In the phase-1 model, the value [Na+]i=18
mmol/L was based on data measured at 22°C to 24°C.37
However, other data suggest that [Na+]i is smaller at 37°C.
Sheu and Fozzard38 obtained Na+ activity (aNai)=6.4+1.2
mmol/L (equivalent to [Na+]i=9.1±1.7 mmol/L), Cannell et
a139 obtained [Na+]i=8 mmol/L, and Abete and Vassalle40
obtained aNai=8 mmol/L ([Na+]i=11.4 mmol/L) at 37°C. An
overestimation of [Na+]i acts to depress the capability of INac
to extrude Ca21 ions out of the cell. On the basis of the 37°C
data and to maintain normal exchanger activity, we set
[Na+]i= 10 mmol/L. The resting [Ca2+]i is set at 0.12 ,umol/L on
the basis of the measured values of 0.136±0.026 ,umol/L by
Takamatsu and Wier41 and ---0.12 ,umol/L by Beuckelmann
and Wier.42
Ionic Currents in the Sarcolemma

INa, the fast Na+ current. The formulation of INa in the
phase-2 model is the same as that in the phase-1 model,'
except that the maximum conductance (GNa) is decreased from
23 to 16 millisiemens/,uF to compensate for the increased
reversal potential (ENa, from 54.4 to 70 mV) due to the lower
[Na+]i (10 instead of 18 mmol/L). Without this adjustment of
GNa, the computed peak inward current is too large for
ventricular cells (>450 ,uA/IF). For GNa=16 millisiemens/,uF,
an acceptable value (380 ,A/,F) is obtained, close to 400
,uA/,F in the phase-1 model. Note that this value of GNa=16
millisiemens/,uF is in the range of measured Na+ conduc-
tances.43 It should be noted that the equation for a; (Appen-
dix 1) is slightly modified from that given in Ebihara and
Johnson (E-J)44; an error in sign in the original E-J article is
corrected, and a factor of 0.1 is introduced to provide a
realistic activation threshold of INa (-58.8 mV) in a mamma-
lian ventricular cell. These adjustments to the E-J formulation
were first introduced in the phase-1 model.'

Ionic currents through the L-type Ca2` channel. The L-type
channel is permeable to Ca2+, Na+, and K', with a perme-
ability ratio of 2800:3.5:1, respectively.5,7'8'45 The total current
through this channel is expressed as the sum of the individual
component currents: ICa,t=ICa+ICa,K+ICaNa (see Appendix 2 for

definitions). Note that in view of the much larger permeability
to Ca 2+, the major contribution to Ilc,, is from lc,. As suggested
by Campbell et al,45 we formulate Ic by using the constant-
field equation (Appendix 1). Similar kinetics are assumed for
ICa,K and 1CaNa, with the major difference being the much
smaller permeabilities of these components. All the data
measured at room temperature are adjusted to the physiolog-
ical body temperature of 37°C, which is based on Qlo of 2.96
measured by Cavalie et al.46 The maximum conductance of lCa
is chosen as GCa=0.9 millisiemens/,F,3 and the corresponding
permeability is Pc =5.4x 10` cm/s. Permeabilities of the other
components are much smaller (Appendix 1) and satisfy the
permeability ratio above.

Activation kinetics (d-gate). Because of the high series resis-
tance and voltage inhomogeneities introduced by the tissue
architecture (gap junctions, endothelium, intercellular cleft
space), the activation kinetics of this channel could not be
measured precisely in multicellular tissue preparations.3 In
single-cell preparations, Isenberg and Klockner3 were the first
to measure the time constant of activation (Td), which was an
order of magnitude faster than suggested by the previous
measurements in tissue preparations. Our formulation of d
(Appendix 1) follows that of Rasmusson et al'0 and results in
activation kinetics an order of magnitude faster than in the
B-R model or in our phase-1 model.

Inactivation kinetics (f and fca). The inactivation process of
Ica has been the subject of controversy since the 1980s. It has
been characterized as purely voltage dependent (only f, Isen-
berg and Kl6ckner3), purely Ca2` dependent (only fCa),47'48 or
as a combined voltage- and Ca2`-dependent process (f . fCa).4-8
On the basis of recent experiments, the combined voltage- and
Ca2`-dependent kinetics is generally more accepted than the
other two possibilities. This is because the voltage dependence
of steady-state inactivation measured by the gapped double-
pulse protocol8 cannot be explained by purely voltage-depen-
dent kinetics. Therefore, we assume that the inactivation
process is both, voltage and [Ca2+]i dependent, and can be
described in terms of a purely voltage-dependent gate f and a
purely [Ca"2]i-dependent gate fCa. To measure the purely
voltage-dependent kinetics (ie, f), Ca2` is replaced by other
ions that are not subject to Ca2`-dependent inactivation.
These include Ba2+, Sr2+, K', and Na+.4,5,6,8,48-50 The use of
these ions to measure the characteristics of f [ie, f.(V) and
rf(V)] has resulted in a variety of conflicting results.5'8'48'49 f. is
described as either partial-U-shaped48'49 or monotonically
is described as either bell-shaped5'8 or
decreasing.8 rf
U-shaped.49 This lack of consistency may be due to the
differences in experimental conditions. Equations describing
these different measurements are presented in Appendix 3.
Note that in the equations the half-saturation potential and
the slope factor are different from the values used by Rasmus-
son et al10 (32 and 8 mV instead of 35.06 and 8.6 mV). These
changes were necessary for the simulated Ic, inactivation
process (in particular the inactivation parameter f.; see "Re-
sults") to be in the range of experimental measurements. In
"Results," these different formulations and the formulation
used in the D-N model9 are tested and compared in terms of
their ability to simulate recent experiments in single ventric-
ular cells under normal physiological conditions ([Ca 2+1o. 1.8
mmol/L). On the basis of these simulations (described in
"Results"), we identified the formulation in Appendix 1 as the
best representation of the voltage-dependent inactivation pro-
cess. This formulation was incorporated in the action potential
model.

The kinetics of the Ca2+-dependent inactivation were first
formulated by Standen and Stanfield.47 This formulation in-
volved an unknown subsarcolemmal space and ionic diffusion
from this space to the myoplasm. Such a small subsarcolemmal
space would result in a high Ca2+ concentration in this layer
and a strong Ca 2+ dependence of inactivation. However, a high
concentration of subsarcolemmal Ca24 was not detected by

measurements of the [Ca2+]i wave using a fura 2 imaging
system.41,42 The measured intracellular [Ca 2+] transient could
be adequately interpreted on the basis of a single compartment
(myoplasm). Therefore, we assume a single compartment and
formulate the Ca2+-dependent inactivation as follows: fCa= 1/
{1+([Ca2+]i/Km,ca)2}, where KmCa (=0.6 gmol/L) is the half-
saturation concentration.
IK, the time-dependent K+ current. In the phase-1 L-R model,'
we introduced a [K+]0 dependence of the IK conductance
[Kjk) but retained the linear dependence of IK on its
(GKGC
activation parameter (IK XX) as suggested by Beeler and
Reuter2 on the basis of experiments conducted in multicellular
preparations. More recent experiments in single cells51 dem-
onstrated an X2 dependence of IK (see equation in Appendix
1). We did not use this form in the phase-1 model because
IK(X2) as suggested by Matsuura et a15' failed to repolarize the
membrane from plateau potentials to rest potential at low
[K+]0. We' stated that this situation would have to be reexam-
ined once a correct formulation of 'Ca was developed and
incorporated in the model. In the phase-2 model presented
here, a correct 'Ca is incorporated (see previous section). With
this reformulated ICa, the situation is reversed, and IK(X2) can
repolarize the membrane to rest at all levels of [K+]0. The
reasons for this different behavior will be explained in "Re-
sults." In the phase-2 model, we adopt the X2 dependence,
since this behavior was demonstrated in single cells.5'

In, the time-independent K' current. The formulation of this
current is the same as in the phase-1 model, except for the
value of the maximum conductance (GKI). GK1 can be obtained
from measurements by Sakmann and Trube52 and data from
Isenberg and Klockner.20 At [K+]0=5.4 mmol/L and 35°C, the
whole-cell IKI conductance is =150 nanosiemens,52 and the
average capacitive membrane area is 2 x 10` cm2.20 Therefore,
average GKI is estimated at 0.75 millisiemen/,F (note the 1
gF/cm2 specific membrane capacity). In the phase-1 model,
the value GK1=0.6 millisiemen/,uF was used on the basis of the
'K1 curve of the B-R model. The reason we did not use the
calculated value of 0.75 millisiemen/gF was that this value
resulted in a plateau potential <0 mV because of the incorrect
formulation of ICa in the B-R model. Such a low level of
plateau potential is not consistent with experimental measure-
ments. In the phase-2 model, lCa
is reformulated, and
GK1=0.75 millisiemen/,F is used.
phase-1 L-R model.

IKP, the plateau K' current. This current is the same as in the
INaCa9 the Na+-Ca2` exchanger. In mammalian cardiac cells, it
is generally accepted that the exchanger stoichiometry
Na+: Ca2` is 3:142,53-56 and that K' ions are not cotransported
by the exchanger.57 The formulation of INaCa was first proposed
by Mullins58 and simplified by DiFrancesco and Noble.9 Ac-
cording to recent experiments,425354 several properties were
not represented correctly by the D-N model. These are as
follows: [Na+]0 dependence, [Ca2+]. dependence, and satura-
tion of INaCa at very negative potentials. A formulation that can
correctly duplicate these properties (see "Results") is listed in
Appendix 1. In this equation, q=0.3542,53,59,60 is the position of
the energy barrier that controls the voltage dependence of
INaCa, and ksat is the saturation factor that ensures saturation at
very negative potentials.

INaK, the Na+-K+ pump. Under a wide range of normal and
abnormal physiological conditions, the reversal potential of
INaK is very negative (. -200 mV).61 Therefore, our formula-
tion of INaK does not consider backward operation of the pump.
In the forward operation, the pump extrudes three Na+ ions
from the cell in exchange for two K' ions that enter the cell.61
A property of INaK that is not simulated correctly by the D-N
model9 or by the model of Rasmusson et al10 is the voltage
dependence of INaK at different levels of [Na+]0. This property
has been measured by Nakao and Gadsby62 and Gadsby and
Nakao.25 The parameter values in Appendix 1 are based on
measurements by several groups.25,62-70 The resting value of

INaK is =0.3 ,A/,F for standard ionic concentrations. The
value of Km,Na (43.2 mmol/L) measured by Mogul et a169 is
much higher than values measured by others (=10 mmol/L).
This high value of KmNa, implies a maximum pump current
(INaK) as high as 10 gA/gFtE in order to predict correctly the
pump current at the resting state.62,67,69,70 Such a high value of
INaK has never been reported. Therefore, Km,Na=10 mmol/L62
is used in our model. Our formulation of INaK is provided in
Appendix 1. This formulation correctly simulates the voltage
dependence for all values of [Na+]0 (see "Results").

,,s(Ca), the nonspecific Ca`2-activated current. This channel is
suspected to conduct the arrhythmogenic transient inward
current (IT,) under Ca 2+-overload conditions. This channel was
not identified in single cardiac cells until Ehara et a171 pre-
sented their observations in guinea pig ventricular cells. The
channel is equally permeable to Na+ and K+7' and much less
permeable to Ca2+.72 Therefore, lns(ca) is regarded as the sum
of the Na+ current (InsNa) and the K' current (Ins,K) through
this channel. Ins(Ca) is formulated by using the constant-field
equation together with a Ca2`-activated term in which the Hill
coefficient is equal to 3 (Appendix 1). The maximum conduc-
tance of this channel is estimated in the range of 7.2 to 72
nanosiemens for the total cell membrane,7' which is equivalent
to a specific conductance of 0.036 to 0.36 millisiemen/,uF
(assuming Cm=200 pF).3 The choice of the value Gns(Ca)=0.072
millisiemen/tF (note that 1 ,uF implies a i-cm2 membrane
area) is based on the data measured by Doerr et a173 (see
"Results"). The corresponding Pns(Ca) is 1.75 x 10-7 cm/s.

Ip,(Ca), the sarcolemmal Ca2+ pump. This pump provides an-
other mechanism, in addition to the exchanger (INaCa), for the
extrusion of Ca 2+ ions out of the cell. As suggested by
Rasmusson et al,10 the pump is included in the model to
maintain the low level of [Ca2"]i at rest. Kmp(Ca)=0.S gmol/L is
obtained from the measurements by Caroni et al.74 Different
values of Km,p(Ca) were used in other models.'0,75,76
IC,,b, the Ca2+ background current. 'Ca,b is formulated as a
linear leakage current. Its contribution to [Ca"]i is balanced
ion extrusion through INaCa and lp(Ca) so that the
by the Ca2
resting level of [Ca2+]i=0.12 gtmol/L is maintained.
INa,b, the Na+ background current. INa,b is also formulated as a
linear leakage current. Its contribution to [Na+]i is balanced by
Na+ ion extrusion through INaK and entry through INaCa so that
the resting level of [Nat]i is maintained.

Iv, the time-independent, purely voltage-dependent current. In
the phase-1 L-R model, the total time-independent current,
IK1(T), was expressed as a summation of IK1, 1Kp, and Ib, where
lb was a K' background current.' In the phase-2 model, lb is
replaced by a summation of INab, 1Ca,b
Ip(Ca)y and INaK. There-
fore, the total time-independent current is not a pure K'
current. To clarify this situation, the notation of IK1(T)
is
changed to Iv, which denotes the total time-independent
current, the sum of six ionic currents. The subscript V indi-
cates that this current depends only on the membrane poten-
tial and not on time.
Ca2' Buffers in the Myoplasm

The Ca 2+ buffers are located in the internal sarcolemma and
the myoplasm. In the sarcolemma, the buffer capacity (>1
mmol/L) is very large but may not play an important role in
Ca2+-buffering during the excitation-contraction coupling cy-
cle.77 In models of Ca2+ movement during muscle contrac-
tion,78 80 sarcolemmal buffers were neglected, and the Ca2+
ions released from the SR were only buffered in the myoplasm
by calmodulin and troponin. We make similar assumptions in
our model. The buffer concentrations listed in Appendix 1
were obtained from Wier and Yue,79 and the buffering kinetics
were from Robertson et al.77 After the approach of Hilgemann
and Noble,75 we compute the steady-state buffering process
numerically by using Steffensen's iterative method. The
steady-state assumption is justified since it differs only slightly
from the dynamic buffering process.

Ca2+ Fluxes in the SR

CICR by the JSR. The mechanism of Ca2` release by the
cardiac SR is known as the CICR process.30-32 Following the
suggestion of Backx et al,80 we represented the release process
in our model by assuming variable ([Ca2]i-dependent) release
kinetics in combination with a fixed threshold for release.
Since we are not considering [Ca2+]i wave propagation,41'80 we
represent the release process as if it occurred from a single
JSR release site, ignoring spatial distribution of the JSR and
the resulting [Ca2+]i propagation.

Beuckelmann and Wier,42 in agreement with Fabiato,30-32
found that the peak intracellular Ca 2+ transient was propor-
tional to the cumulative amount of Ca 2+ ions that enters the
cell within 10 milliseconds from the onset of stimulation, with
almost no further increase due to Ca 2+ entering the cell later
than the first 10 milliseconds. This implies that the amount of
Ca24 released from the JSR depends on the amount of Ca2+
that enters the cell within 10 milliseconds from the onset of
stimulation. In the model, we compute the increase in [Ca 2+]
2 milliseconds (rather than 10 milliseconds) from the time of
Vmax and denote it as A[Ca2+]i,2. This adjustment is made to
account for the faster kinetics at 37°C (Beuckelmann and
Wier's data are at 23°C). It is also consistent with the time of
peak ICa (2 milliseconds, Fig liB), when [Ca2+]i-dependent
inactivation of Ic, is significant, implying a sufficiently large
intracellular Ca2+ transient that requires JSR release as early
as at 2 milliseconds. On the basis of the data of Beuckelmann
and Wier,42 JSR release of Ca 2+ ions is triggered at clamping
potentials more positive than -30 mV. This potential thresh-
old is equivalent to an increase of [Ca2+]i by 0.18 ,mol/L.
Therefore, we define A[Ca2li,th=0.18 ,umol/L as the threshold
for JSR release. This value is in agreement with the measure-
ments by Kawano et al.81 The complete formulation of Irel due
to CICR is provided in Appendix 1. The [Ca2+]i-dependent
term is multiplied by a two-exponential term with time con-
stants for the activation (ron) and deactivation (T0ff) of the
release process. The half-saturation concentration K,,,re=0.8
tmol/L was obtained from Chamberlain et al.82 rn= roff=2
milliseconds is set to ensure that the pulse-release is com-
pleted in 5 milliseconds.

Ca2+ release by the JSR under Ca2-overload conditions. It is
commonly found that spontaneous contractions occur in
skinned cardiac cells,30 in damaged tissues,83 and in intact rat
ventricular cells.84 Normal CICR from the JSR requires exter-
nal triggering (IA[Ca2`]i in the myoplasm, outside the JSR). An
alternative triggering process occurs from within the JSR
under Ca24-overload conditions. A simple heuristic model of
spontaneous Ca 2+ release from the JSR was proposed by
Capogrossi et al84 and Stern et al.33 In this simple model, JSR
releases all of its stored Ca 2+ ions once the level of its
releasable Ca24 pool reaches a threshold, and then JSR-Ca2+
is replenished following a monoexponential time course. In
our model, JSR is reloaded by Ca2+ ions from the NSR
through a translocation process described by a simple monoex-
ponential function. The threshold for internal triggering of
Ca2+ release from the overloaded JSR depends on the species.
The tendency for spontaneous Ca2+ release, in a decreasing
order, is: rat>hamster>dog>cat>guinea pig>rabbit.34 In
normal rat ventricular cells at rest, spontaneous release can
occur. Since most of the releasable Ca2+ in the JSR binds to
the buffer calsequestrin (CSQN), we define the threshold in
terms of percent [CSQN] that is Ca24 bound. In rat ventricular
cells at rest and under normal conditions (no Ca24 overload),
68.5% of total [CSQN] binds with Ca24 ions. In the model, we
set the threshold for spontaneous release at [CSQN]th=70%
for the rat. For species other than the rat [CSQNIth is >70%.
The complete formulation of the spontaneous release process
is provided in Appendix 1.
CSQN, the Ca2` buffer in the JSR. The Ca2+ buffer CSQN
increases the releasable pool of Ca24 ions in the JSR. Other-
wise, with such a small volume fraction of the cell

(FJSR=0.48%), JSR cannot store sufficient Ca24 ions to cause
muscle contraction on release. The maximum value
[CSQN]=31 mmol/L and the half-saturation concentration
Kll,CSQN=0.8 mmol/L were used by Cannell and Allen78 in
skeletal muscle simulations. It should be noted that the
myoplasmic Ca2'-buffering capacity in skeletal muscle is much
greater than in cardiac muscle; therefore, the value
[CSQN]=10 mmol/L is used in our model to ensure that JSR
is almost completely depleted of its Ca24 contents during each
excitation-contraction cycle and that the simulated peak intra-
cellular Ca2
transient is consistent with measured data.
Similar to buffering in the myoplasm, we compute the buffer-
ing process in the JSR using Steffensen's iterative method
assuming steady state.

Is,, and Ikk, Ca2` uptake and leakage by the NSR. Because of
its small volume fraction (0.48%) and slow rate of Ca24
uptake, Ca24 uptake from the myoplasm by the JSR is
negligible.27 Therefore, in the model, direct uptake by the JSR
is neglected, and Ca24 ions enter the JSR only through the
NSR by a translocation process. The kinetics of Ca24 uptake
from the myoplasm by the NSR can be described by the
Michaelis-Menten equation (Haynes and Mandveno85) shown
in Appendix 1. On the basis of experimental findings85'86 and
model simulations,79,80 maximum [Ca 21]
in the NSR
([Ca2+INsR) is equal to 15 mmol/L, the Hill coefficient is 1, and
half-saturation concentration (Km,up) is 0.92 ,umol/L. A maxi-
mum uptake rate (Iup) faster than 0.003 mmol/L per millisec-
ond is necessary to reload into the NSR all the Ca24 ions that
were released from the JSR during an action potential.32
Therefore, Iup=0.005 mmol/L per millisecond was chosen in
the model. The net rate of Ca2+ uptake into the NSR is the
difference between lup and lleak, where 1leak=- Keak- [Ca2+4]NSR
To obtain [Ca2+INSR=15 mmol/L, the leakage rate of Ca24 out
of the NSR (1'leak) is set equal to IUp/[CaI2+NsR=0.000333 ms'.
Itr, translocation of Ca2` ions from the NSR to the JSR. The
kinetics of Ca2+ translocation from the uptake store (NSR) to
the release store (JSR) was elucidated by investigating force-
interval relations such as postextrasystolic restitution and
potentiation.79,87 Both relations can be described by monoex-
ponential functions with the same time constant.87 On the
basis of the data (rtr=182+44 milliseconds or Ttr=176-'-18
milliseconds) measured by Yue et al,87 'rr=180 milliseconds is
chosen for the time constant in the model. The complete
equation for Ilr is provided in Appendix 1.

Results

The "Results" section is divided into two parts. The
first set of simulations (Figs 2 through 12) deals with
properties of the individual components of the model.
In particular, we evaluate the representation of each
component by simulating relevant experimental proto-
cols and comparing the simulated results with published
experimental findings. We also use the simulations to
answer important questions related to the characteris-
tics and mechanisms of the various component pro-
cesses. Since INa, 1K1, and IKp are the same as in the
phase-1 model, they are not discussed here. The second
set of simulations (Figs 13 through 19) deals with the
integration of the various components into a complete
model of the action potential and investigates the role
and contribution of each component at different phases
of the action potential.

inactivation (f.); B, the time constant (a,). Note that rf is normal-
ized to its maximum value. The maximum X, is 20 milliseconds for
DiFrancesco and Noble,9 50 milliseconds for Rasmusson et al,10
and 253.2 milliseconds for Kass and Sanguinetti.5 V indicates
membrane potential. Data for Hadley and Hume are presented in
Reference 8. Equations are provided in Appendix 3.

f is a purely voltage-dependent gate and fca depends
only on the concentration of free Ca2' ions in the
myoplasm, [Ca"]i. As mentioned in "Materials and
Methods," several conflicting measurements and differ-
ent formulations of the f-gate exist in the litera-
ture.584849 Steady-state inactivation (f.) and the time
constant (,f) from several studies are plotted in Fig 2A
and 2B, respectively, for the range of membrane poten-
tials from -100 to + 100 mV. Corresponding equations
are provided in Appendix 3. f. and if, measured by
Campbell et a149 and formulated by Rasmusson et al,10
are partially U-shaped (f., Fig 2A) and fully U-shaped
(1rf, Fig 2B). f, and if, measured by Kass and Sangui-
netti5 and Hadley and Hume,8 are monotonically de-
creasing to a nonzero value (f., Fig 2A) and are
bell-shaped (7,f, Fig 2B). All of these parameters were
obtained by using the gapped double-pulse protocol
(see below). In contrast, f. in the D-N model is based on
measurements using the conventional double-step pro-
tocol (described below) and is monotonically decreasing
to zero (Fig 2A). if in the D-N model is monotonically
increasing to the value of 20 milliseconds (normalized to
1 in Fig 2B). For a more complete comparison of
possible formulations, we add another set (f. and if),
where f. is monotonically decreasing to zero (our fit to
the conventional double-step data, Fig 2A) and if is
bell-shaped (Kass-Sanguinetti, Fig 2B). In the following

simulations, we use these four different formulations of
f in an attempt to reconcile the differences between
them and to relate them to the different experimental
protocols used for their measurements. In all simula-
tions (except the D-N model), fca of Appendix 1 was
used. Simulations involving the D-N model used the
D-N formulation as depicted in Appendix 3. Protocols 1
and 2 below follow the experimental protocols of Camp-
bell et al.49

Protocol 1: f. (c), steady-state inactivation measured by
the conventional double-step protocol. The protocol is as
follows: membrane potential is first stepped from -60
mV to various potentials for 1000 milliseconds and then
(second step) to 10 mV for 100 milliseconds and finally
clamped back to the holding potential of -60 mV. From
the peak inward current obtained at the second step,
one subtracts the minimum current at the end of this
step. This difference peak inward current (called the
"visual estimate" current by Isenberg and Klockner3) is
normalized by its maximum value and plotted as a
function of the different potentials of the first step. The
resulting steady-state inactivation curve reflects the
combined voltage- and Ca'-dependent processes (f,
and fca, respectively) and is denoted as f(c) to differ-
entiate it from fQ(g), measured by the gapped double-
pulse protocol (see below). We simulate this protocol by
using our model (L-R) with the conventional f, and r of
Kass and Sanguinetti,5 with f. of Hadley and Hume8 and
i-f of Kass and Sanguinetti, and with f of Rasmusson et
al.10 In addition, the D-N model is used for the simula-
tion. f.(c) obtained by using the different models is quite
similar and is adequately described by the conventional
Boltzmann equation f. =1/{1 +exp[(V-Vh)/K]} with dif-
ferent values of slope factor (K) and half-saturation
potential (Vh). Parameter values for the different mod-
els are as follows: Vh=-35 mV and K= -8.26 for the
conventional f. and 7 of Kass and Sanguinetti, Vh= -35
mV and K= -5.1 mV for f, of Hadley and Hume and rf
of Kass and Sanguinetti, Vh=-35 mV and K=-5.65
mV for f of Rasmusson et al, and Vh= -32.5 mV and
K=-5.92 mV for the D-N model. Note that these
different values are all in the range of measure-
ments.35488889 On the basis of these simulations, it is
clear that the conventional double-step protocol cannot
separate the four different models tested.

Protocol 2: f.(g), steady-state inactivation measured by
the gapped double-pulse protocol. The protocol is shown in
the inset of Fig 3A and is described in the legend. The
peak inward current obtained at the second pulse is
normalized by its maximum value and is plotted as a
function of the different potentials of the first pulse. We
denote the resulting inactivation parameter as fQ(g).
Two conditions are investigated in the simulations: (1)
[Ca`],==0.12 ,umol/L is fixed throughout the simulation
(denoted as [Ca+]i-fixed in the figure); this condition
eliminates the Ca2' dependence of inactivation (fca),
and only the voltage-dependence (f) is obtained. (2)
[Ca2]i is free to change during the simulation (denoted
as [Ca]i-unclamped in the figure); this condition pro-
vides a measure of the steady-state inactivation as a
product of fCa and f. Simulation results obtained with
the same four models as in the previous protocol are
shown in Fig 3. As expected, fx(g) obtained under the
[Ca]i-fixed condition is about the same as the purely
voltage-dependent f, shown in Fig 2. Note that unlike

[f,(g)] obtained by the gapped double-pulse protocol.
A through D correspond to formulations 1 through 4 in
Appendix 3. The protocol is shown in the inset of panel
A; membrane is clamped to various potentials for 500
milliseconds (first pulse), and after a gap of 2 millisec-
onds at the holding potential (-60 my), a second
clamping pulse to 0 mV for 100 milliseconds is ap-
plied. Two conditions ([Ca]i-fixed and [Ca]i-
unclamped) are investigated. The results indicate that
only the formulations in panel B and panel C can
duplicate the partial-U shape found experimentally. V
indicates membrane potential; L-R, the Luo and Rudy
model; and f and f., inactivation parameters. Data are
taken from Hadley and Hume,8 Rasmusson et al,10
and DiFrancesco and Noble.9

f.(c), f(g) does not go to zero at positive potentials in
Fig 3A and 3D. This is because at the onset of the
second pulse, f is partially recovered from the fully
inactivated state at the end of the first pulse (in the
gapped protocol, the two pulses are separated by a gap
of =2 milliseconds that permits partial recovery of f). In
the range of positive potentials, f (~fx) at the time of
peak inward current at the second pulse is
0.14 and
0.5 in panels A and D, respectively, of Fig 3. fQ(g)
obtained under the [Ca]i-unclamped condition is very
different and reflects, in addition to voltage depen-
dence, the effects of changes in [Ca21]j. The models that
adopt the conventional f. (Fig 3A and the D-N model in
Fig 3D) fail to duplicate the partial-U shape of the
steady-state inactivation as obtained from the gapped
double-pulse experiments.4,6S8,4849 However, two of the
models (Hadley and Hume,8 Fig 3B; Rasmusson et al,10
Fig 3C) successfully simulate the partial-U shape. The
difference between these two models is that the [Ca2+]p
dependent component plays a much more important
role in determining fQ(g) in the Hadley and Hume
model (compare panels B and C in Fig 3).
Reconstruction of the action potential. The previous
simulations indicate that the Hadley and Hume8 and the
Rasmusson et a110 formulations of fQ(g) cannot be easily
distinguished and compared when using either the
gapped double-pulse or the conventional double-step
protocols. A further test procedure is to reconstruct the
action potential by using these two different represen-
tations of f. These simulations are shown in Fig 4. Fig
4A depicts the experimental measurements of Doerr et
al73 using the action-potential clamp technique. The
experimental result (Fig 4A) is duplicated reasonably
well by the model that adopts the f-gate of Rasmusson
et al (Fig 4B). Note that both experiment (Fig 4A) and
simulation (Fig 4B) show zero contribution of 1Ca to the
action potential for V< -35 mV (arrows) during the
repolarization phase, as mentioned in "Materials and
Methods." In contrast, the action potential simulated
using the formula of Hadley and Hume (Fig 4C) does
not duplicate the experiment successfully. The action

potential duration (APD) is very long (-415 millisec-
onds). This results from the following property of this
model: when the membrane potential decreases gradu-
ally during the plateau phase, 1Ca increases (Fig 4C,
bottom) because of the monotonic increase of f, as the
membrane potential repolarizes from +40 to -30 mV
(Fig 2A). 1Ca continues to increase until the membrane
potential is more negative than -20 mV. At this poten-
tial, Ica becomes largely inactivated because of the small
value of the d-gate. This increasing inward (depolariz-
ing) current during the plateau and repolarization

phases acts to oppose the outward (repolarizing) 'K and
prolongs the action potential. It is clear that the simu-
lated ICa (Fig 4C, bottom) deviates greatly during the
plateau and repolarization phases of an action potential
from the experimental findings (Fig 4A, bottom). Note
that in contrast to the increase of the Hadley and Hume
f, as the membrane potential repolarizes, f. based on
the Rasmusson et al formulation decreases monotoni-
cally as the membrane potential repolarizes from +50 to
0 mV and remains smaller than 0.2 down to -20 mV
(Fig 2A). Of course, the conventional f. (Fig 4D) cannot
support a realistic value of Ia, during the plateau
because of its almost zero value at plateau potentials
(Fig 2A). In conclusion, only the formulation of Ilc
inactivation suggested by Rasmusson et al can simulate
successfully the conventional double-step protocol, the
gapped double-pulse protocol, and ICa during the action
potential. We adopt this formulation in our (L-R)
model (Appendix 1) and use it in all of the simulations
that follow.
Other Characteristics of ICa

The inactivation characteristics of 'Ca are complex,
and their elucidation required several simulations, as
described in the previous section. This section deals
with other properties of ICa. Similar to the previous
section, simulations are conducted and interpreted in
relation to experimental findings.

Peak inward current andpeak intracellular Ca2+ transient.
The L-type channel is permeable to Ca2', K+, and Na+.
The permeability ratio of Ca2': K+: Na+ is 2800:3.5:1. 'Ca.t
is the sum of the three ionic currents (ICa, 1CaK, and ICaNa)
through this channel. By clamping the membrane poten-
tial from -60 mV to various potentials for 100 millisec-
onds and then back to the holding potential of -60 mV,
the peak inward currents of lCa,t and its three individual
components can be obtained. We have computed these
currents as a function of membrane potential by simulat-
ing this protocol using our (L-R) model. lc,, and lca almost
overlap for V<35 mV, and both display a bell-shaped
behavior as a function of membrane potential (not
shown). In the range of potentials from -50 to 90 mV, IcL
is an inward current because the Nernst potential of the
Ca2' ions (Ec,N)=127.5 mV and its maximum peak value
is located at =0 mV; 1Ca,K is an outward current; and ICa,Na
is an inward current for V'ENa,N (70 mV). The reversal
potential (Ecm) of the L-type channel is at V=+56 mV,
where Ic
is the "apparent"
reversal potential3,45 and can be computed by using the
formula derived by Campbell et al.45 One should note that
the formula Ica=Gca d . f- fca- (V-Eca) represents the
Ca2' current only in the range of V<35 mV, where 'Cat
and 'Ca almost overlap. For V.35 mV, Ca,K is significant
and lCa,t becomes an outward current for V.56 mV, where
1Ca,K is the major component current through the L-type
channel. For comparison, we computed the peak inward
currents using the D-N model. The behavior of these
currents is similar to that in the L-R model, except that
the reversal potential (Ec =75 mV, instead of ECa=56 mV
in the L-R model) is very different and is not consistent
with the value predicted by the constant-field equation.45
As stated above, the peak amplitude of ICa as a
function of the clamp potential is bell-shaped. If a larger
peak inward current implies increased Ca 2+ entry into
the cell during the first 2 milliseconds after the onset of

is zero. This value of Ec.

Ca2+ transient and Ca2+ entry. The protocol was to clamp the
membrane potential from -60 mV to various potentials for 100
milliseconds and then back to the holding potential of -60 mV.
As predicted by the kinetics of the Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release
process, the peak intracellular Ca2+ transient is proportional to
the cumulative Ca2
entry 2 milliseconds from onset of stimulus

Beuckelmann and Wier.42) L-R indicates the Luo and Rudy

normalization causes an apparent crossover of the experimental
curves).

depolarization, the amount of Ca2+ released from the
JSR will also increase on the basis of the kinetics of the
CICR process. This, in turn, will cause an increase of
the peak intracellular Ca2+ transient. In Fig 5, both the
Ca2' entry during the first 2 milliseconds from the onset
of stimulus and peak intracellular Ca2+ transient are
shown to be bell-shaped (protocol is the same as that for
obtaining the peak L-type currents above; see legend of
Fig 5). Fig 5A shows the simulated results; Fig 5B shows
the corresponding experimental data of Beuckelmann
and Wier42 (their Fig 15A). The almost identical shape
and near proportionality of the Ca2' entry curve and
the peak intracellular Ca21 transient curve support the
CICR hypothesis and proposed kinetics. The similarity
of the Ca 2+ entry curve (Fig 5) and the peak ICa
bell-shaped curve (not shown) supports the hypothesis
that a larger peak inward current results in a larger Ca2+
entry during the first 2 milliseconds. The similarity of
the simulated curves (Fig SA) and the experimental
curves (Fig SB) demonstrates that the kinetics of ICa and
of the CICR process are represented accurately in our
model.

current (ica), cumulative Ca2+ entry at 2 milliseconds ([Ca]-
entry), and tail transient (A[Ca]j). The protocol (inset) is to clamp
the membrane potential from -50 to +80 mV for 20 milliseconds
and then back to various repolarizing potentials. A shows that
the tail transient does not follow the monotonic increase of the
peak inward current. However, B shows that A[Ca]i follows
[Cal-entry, in agreement with the proposed kinetics of the
Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release process. Currents shown are for 1
,uF of membrane capacitance. V indicates membrane potential.

is distinct from the intracellular Ca2+ transient during
depolarization discussed in the preceding section. It is
suggested that tail transients arise from SR Ca2+ release
triggered by tails of the Ca2+ current.42 These tails occur
when the driving force for Ca2+ influx is increased by
repolarization and the Ca2+ conductance has not yet
become deactivated. The dependence of tail transients
on the repolarization voltage can be studied by using the
protocol shown in the inset of Fig 6A and described in
the legend. The tail transient is computed by subtracting
the average [Ca2+i] during depolarization from the peak
[Ca2+]i after onset of repolarization. Fig 6A shows the
tail transient, A[Ca2+]i, and the peak tail Ca2+ current,
'Ca, as a function of the repolarization voltage, V. Note
that for repolarizing steps to membrane potentials more
negative than -20 mV, the tail transient decreases
while the (negative) magnitude of peak 'Ca increases.
This behavior is in agreement with a similar experimen-
tal observation42 that A[Ca2+]i is not related directly to
peak IcL for all values of V. In contrast, Fig 6B shows
that the simulated tail transient is proportional to the
cumulative Ca2+ entry 2 milliseconds after the onset of
repolarization for all values of V. This proportionality is
consistent with the CICR process and was observed
experimentally as well.42 The lack of proportionality

between peak Ic and A[Ca2"i (Fig 6A) and the propor-
tionality between A[Ca'4]i and Ca'4 entry (Fig 6B)
imply that peak ICa and Ca'4 entry are not proportional
for all values of V. The reason that a larger peak inward
Ca'+ current does not always result in a larger Ca'4
entry is the fast inactivation of 'Ca at potentials more
negative than -20 mV. As the repolarization potential
becomes more negative than -20 mV, the monotonic
decrease of d. and rd causes an early inactivation of 'Ca
so that in spite of the large peak inward lCa, the total
Ca2' entry during the first 2 milliseconds is reduced.
For instance, 'Ca for step repolarization to -90 mV
attains a larger peak inward current (374 ,tA/,uF com-
pared with 252 ,uA/,F) but inactivates much faster than
ICa for step repolarization to -60 mV. As a result, the
cumulative Ca'4 entry 2 milliseconds after the onset of
repolarization is smaller for V= -90 mV ([Ca'2] en-
try=3.96 ,umol/L) than for V=-60 mV ([Ca'2] en-
try=4.2 ,umol/L).

Slow recovery from inactivation. The issue of slow recov-
ery from inactivation of Ica was first discussed in 1974,9°
but its underlying mechanism is still not completely un-
derstood. This is because the values of the time constant of
slow recovery from inactivation (Trec) are widely scattered.
At V= -50 mV, Isenberg and Klockner3 obtained irec=45
milliseconds. Two time constants of recovery were ob-
tained by Josephson et al,4 Trec(fast)= 122 milliseconds and
'ree(slow)=433 milliseconds. Campbell et a149 obtained the
relation reC=728 * exp(V/46.5) milliseconds, which differs
from the data above. These inconsistencies complicate
and limit the comparison between the simulation results
and measured data.

In the model, 'Ca inactivation is formulated as a
function not only of membrane potential but also of
[Ca'4]i. As a result, the recovery of Ica is affected by the
level of the intracellular Ca'4 transient during repolar-
ization. During repolarization, INaCa is activated to pump
Ca'4 ions out of the cell; therefore, the time course of
the intracellular Ca'4 transient is determined by the
pumping capacity of INaCa. In the range of membrane
potentials from -100 to -30 mV, the time constant of
the inactivation f-gate in the model is <50 milliseconds,
whereas the time it takes for [Ca'4]I to decrease from its
peak value to its resting state value during repolariza-
tion is much longer than 50 milliseconds. Therefore, the
recovery from inactivation of 'Ca in the model is con-
trolled mostly by the time course of [Ca'4]i and hence by
the pumping capability of INaCa during repolarization.
The conventional protocol used to obtain rrec is shown
in the inset of Fig 7 and is described in the legend.
Based on our simulations, the relation rre,=355 * exp(V/
109.5) is obtained and plotted in Fig 7. Compared with
the experimental data at V=-50 mV, we obtained
rrecmodel=212.8 milliseconds, much slower than the 45
milliseconds measured by Isenberg and Klockner3 and
the 122 milliseconds (fast) measured by Josephson et
al.4 However, it is close to the 272±+31.9 milliseconds
measured by Campbell et a149 and smaller than the 433
milliseconds (slow) measured by Josephson et al.4
IK, the Time-Dependent K' Current

As discussed in "Materials and Methods," IK in the
phase-2 model was reformulated on the basis of the
study of Matsuura et al,51 who found that IK X2 (rather
than IK z X, as proposed by Beeler and Reuter2 and

double-pulse recovery protocol is shown in the inset; for a fixed
holding potential V (the membrane was held at this potential for
1 minute to ensure steady state), the interval between two
clamping pulses (0 mV in amplitude and 100 milliseconds in
duration) was varied from 40 to 1000 milliseconds to measure
the recovery of lCa The relation between the peak inward current
measured at the second pulse and the interval between pulses
fits a single exponential with a single time constant (rrec). By
varying the holding potential, ire,

ed) protocol for different values of V (black dots). The relation

adopted in our phase-1 model). In the phase-1 model IK
of Matsuura et al could not repolarize the membrane
from plateau to resting potential at low [K+],. This
situation is reexamined here, since other currents in the
model, and in particular 'Ca, have been reformulated in
the phase-2 model. We have simulated the action
potential and the slow inward current (Isi) by using the
phase-1 model (Isi is the same as in the B-R model) and
the action potential and 'Ca using the phase-2 model.
Both simulations are for low [K+]0=2 mmol/L. 'Si in the
phase-1 simulation is still very large when the mem-
brane potential repolarizes below -35 mV. This is
inconsistent with the experimental findings73 and results
from the incorrect kinetics of the activation d-gate in the
B-R model, in which d, does not go to zero at potentials
more negative than -35 mV. This significant nonzero
inward current at V< -35 mV leads to an incorrect
behavior.1 For IK of Matsuura et al, the value of the
X-gate is very small at Vc-35 mV, and IK is even
smaller because of its X2 dependence. Therefore, IK Of
Matsuura et al fails to repolarize the membrane at this
low [K'], (a condition that brings about a reduction in
GK) because of the significant opposing inward 1,i at
these potentials. In contrast, in the phase-2 model, 'Ca is
zero for membrane potentials more negative than -35
mV, and IK of Matsuura et al can adequately repolarize
the membrane. Also, the simulated APDs for [K+]0=2
mmol/L are 540 and 325 milliseconds in the phase-1 and
phase-2 models, respectively. Under conditions of
[K+]0=3.8 mmol/L and [Ca2`]0=3 mmol/L, Robinson et
a191 obtained APD= 192±16 milliseconds in isolated
canine ventricular cells. For the same conditions, the
APD computed by the phase-2 model is 205 millisec-
onds, very close to the measured APD. In contrast, the
APD computed by the phase-1 model is unrealistically
long (410 milliseconds) because of the unrealistically
large contribution of 1,i at Vc-35 mV in this model.

mmol/L. The currents are simulated using the lK formu-
lation adopted in the present (phase-2) model, ie, IKXX2
as suggested by Matsuura et a151 (see Appendix 1). As a
result, significant crossover between current-voltage
curves at different values of [K'], is observed. This is
different from the minimal crossover observed in the
phase-1 model (Fig 11 of Luo and Rudyi). Also, the
degree of inward rectification of the inactivation IK
Xi-gate of Matsuura et al is ;4.8 times smaller than that
of the B-R model IK, resulting in a fully activated
outward IK (IK, Matsuura et al), which is much larger
than the B-R IK at positive potentials, enhancing its
ability to repolarize the membrane at this potential
range.
I,s(ca), the Nonspecific Ca2'-Activated Current

This current is equally permeable to K' and Na+ and,
therefore, is the sum of these two currents (ie,
Ins(Ca)=lnsK+Ins,Na). In our model (simulation results are
not shown), Ins,K displays outward rectification, whereas
Ins,Na displays inward rectification. 1ns(ca), the sum of
these two currents, appears as a linear leakage current
with a reversal potential of ~0 mV, as measured by
Ehara et al.71 Under normal conditions (no Ca> over-
load, PnS(Ca)=l.75xl0-7, and [Ca2],i=0.12 ,mol/L), the
maximum Ins(Ca)
is <0.008 ,uA/,uF over the range of
membrane potential from -100 to +100 mV (a negli-
gible contribution). This current becomes significant,
however, under conditions of Ca' overload.73 In the
model, for [Ca2+]i=0.4 ,mol/L, 1ns(ca) reaches an ampli-
tude of 4.4 ,uA/,uF.
The value of the maximum conductance, Gns(Ca),
estimated by Ehara et al,71 is in the wide range of 7.2 to
72 nanosiemens for the total cell membrane, which is
equivalent to specific conductance in the range of 0.036
to 0.36 millisiemen/,uF. To decide on a specific value of
Gns(Ca) within this range, we plotted the simulated action
potential and compared it with the experimental results
of Doerr et a173 (their Fig 5). When 1,s(ca) is activated, an
additional outward current is present at plateau poten-
tials, and an additional inward current is present during
the repolarization phase. As a result, plateau potentials
are decreased, and the rate of repolarization is also
decreased, resulting in a prolongation of the APD. With
GnS(Ca)=0.072 millisiemen/,uF (or P,S(ca1)=1 .75x10-7 cm!

s), the simulated behavior shown in Fig 13 duplicates
accurately the experimental behavior obtained by Doerr
et a173 (their Fig 5). As stated above, for this value of
Pns(ca), the contribution of 1ns(Ca) is practically negligible.
INaK, the Na+-K+ Pump

The amplitude of INaK is a function of [Na+]i, [K+]10
[Na+],, and the membrane potential.25'62 The depen-
dence of INaK on [Na+]i and [K+], is formulated by Hill
equations, as depicted in Appendix 1. The dependence
of INaK on the membrane potential is a function of
[Na+I0. This property is simulated in Fig 9, which
duplicates correctly the experimental findings of Nakao
and Gadsby62 (their Fig 3). For the normal concentra-
tion of [Na+1I=140 mmol/L, INaK depends strongly on
the membrane potential, whereas at low values of
[Na+]1 the dependence is decreased. At all values of
[Na+],, INaK saturates for membrane potential >0 mV.
INaC, the Na+-Ca2' Exchanger
Fig 1OA simulates the voltage dependence of INaCa for
three different values of [Na+]1 in a [Na+]i-free prepa-
ration, a situation that turns off the Ca2+-influx mode of
INaCa. Under these conditions, INaCa becomes an inward
current (Ca 2+ efflux and Na+ influx with a stoichiometry
of 1: 3). The simulations (solid marks) duplicate well the
experimental measurements (open marks) by Kimura et
a153 (their Fig 8B). In Fig lOB, three additional simula-
tions (solid marks) are shown to duplicate the experi-
ments (open marks) by Kimura et a153 (their Fig 9A)
and by Beuckelmann and Wier92 (B-W) (their Fig 6B).
These include the voltage dependence of INaCa as a
function of [Ca 2+]o and [Ca 2+]i. INaCa(V) is shown for
[Ca2+]0=1 mmol/L and [Ca2+]0=4 mmol/L in a prepa-
ration of [Na+]0=140 mmol/L, [Na+]i=10 mmol/L, and
[Ca2+]i=0.172 ,umol/L (Fig 9A of Kimura et al53). The
B-W curve is for [Ca2']0=2 mmol/L, [Ca2`]i=0.45

Note that the dependence of INaCa on [Ca2+]0 is dupli-
cated well as [Ca2+]0 is changed from 1 to 4 mmol/L. A

INaCa(V) at very negative potentials are simulated well,
except for the curve of [Ca'2],=1 mmol/L. This is
because INaCa measured by Kimura et a153 at [Ca+o 1
mmol/L increases slightly at very negative potentials,
probably because of contamination by other currents in
this potential range. It should be mentioned that
k,at0=.25 and 71=0.35 provide the best fit for these
simulations. However, to reconstruct the action poten-
tial, k,at=0.1 is used. This is because for the large value
(ksat=0.25), the Ca2+-efflux mode of INaCa is depressed,
and Ca 2+ ions enter the cell through the exchanger. This

APs are superimposed: one is for normal INaCa (normal condi-
tions); the other is for conditions in which INaCa is doubled. The

remains unchanged. Currents shown are for 1 ,iF of membrane

contradicts the physiological role of INaCa, which is to
extrude Ca2` ions out of the cell. Therefore, k,at=0.1 is
used throughout the simulations below. In Fig 11, a
simulated action potential is shown (top) for two differ-
ent strengths of INaCa, normal and twice the normal
amplitude (bottom). The only effect of the increase in
INaCa is to prolong the APD without affecting its plateau
potentials. This behavior is consistent with the experi-
mental findings of Doerr et al73 (their Fig 4).
Iv, the Total Time-Independent Current

This current replaces the IK1(T) current in the phase-1
model1 and is the sum of all the time-independent
currents, including INaK, lp(Ca)y IK1, IKp, 1Ca,b, INa,by and
Ins(Ca) (if activated). In Fig 12A, Iv and its components
are shown for the range of membrane potentials from
-100 to +50 mV. Note the major contribution of IKI (at
V<0 mV) and IKp (at V>0 mV) to Iv. In Fig 12B,
current-voltage curves of Iv are shown for four different
values of [K'],. Similar to IK1(T) of the phase-1 model1
(their Fig 3) and the experimental findings of Sakmann
and Trube52 (their Fig 4A), Iv is characterized by a
phase of negative slope and a large degree of crossover
between the curves for different values of [K+],.
Ionic Currents and Concentration Changes During
the Action Potential

In the action potential simulations, Grel of the JSR is
set to 60 mmol/L per millisecond, which is higher than
18 mmol/L per millisecond used in the square-pulse
voltage-clamp simulations that were described in the
previous sections. This is because the value of peak 'Ca
in the action potential simulations is -6.27 ,uA/,F (Fig
13 below), much lower than the maximum peak 'Ca of
-32 ,uA/,uF in the square-pulse voltage-clamp simula-
tions. This behavior is in agreement with the experimen-
tal findings of Doerr et al,73 who used action potential
clamp instead of square-pulse voltage clamp to study
the current density of lCa. Doerr et al found that the

by the square-pulse voltage clamp used by Isenberg and
Klockner3 or by other groups.468893 Therefore, in the
action potential simulations, to obtain a peak intracel-
lular Ca' transient of 1.0 ,umol/L (Fig 5A) with a low
peak Ica, Gre had to be increased from 18 to 60 mmol/L
per millisecond. This adjustment is consistent with the
experimental results of Beuckelmann and Wier,42 who
found that the peak intracellular Ca2' transient mea-
sured by the action potential clamp could reach the
same peak value (or even a higher value) than that
measured by the square-pulse voltage clamp. This may
be because the physiological state of the cell is modified
when the square-pulse voltage clamp is applied, affect-

potential of 46.5 mV (see Fig 13) and inactivates
immediately. Subsequently, ICa is activated to support
the action potential plateau95 against the repolarizing
currents Iv and IK. 'Ca reaches its peak value of -6.27

shape of the action potential (AP). The fast kinetics and large
amplitude of the fast Na+ current (INa, B) result in the upstroke of
the AP (A). The L-type Ca2+ current (lc, C) is also activated
quickly to support the action potential plateau against the repo-
larizing K+ current (IK, D) and the total time-independent current
(1v, E). Finally, the large increase of IK and the late peak of lv during
its negative slope phase repolarize the membrane to the resting
potential. During the late repolarization and early postrepolariza-
tion phases, the NaW-Ca2+ exchange current (INaCa, F) is activated
to extrude Ca2+ ions out of the cell and contributes an additional
component of inward current. Currents shown are for 1 ,uF of
membrane capacitance.

,A/,F in 3.23 milliseconds after the onset of stimu-
lation, whereas INa reaches its (much larger) peak
value of -380 ,uA/,uF in 1 millisecond, a time when Ic
is still very small (-0.97 ,uA/,F). Therefore, the early
peak of 'Ca contributes very little to the rising phase of
the action potential. However, the early peak of 'Ca
determines the cumulative Ca2+ entry 2 milliseconds
after the onset of Vma, and, in turn, the release of Ca2+
from the JSR and the resulting intracellular Ca2+
transient (see below). Finally, the large increase of the
delayed IK together with Iv that operates at its negative
slope range (peak Iv at -180 milliseconds, Fig 13)
repolarizes the membrane to the resting potential. In
the last panel of Fig 13, INaCa has almost zero contri-
bution during most of the action potential plateau but
is activated during the late plateau and repolarization
phases to extrude Ca2, ions out of the cell.76 Note that
at the late repolarization phase, 'Ca is inactivated, but
INaCa is activated and slows down the rate of membrane
repolarization.73 The APD is -180 milliseconds in the
measurement range of 207±31 milliseconds96 and
close to the value of 184.6 milliseconds estimated from
the experimental results of Doerr et al.73 Other quan-
titative measures of the simulated action potential
morphology are also consistent with experiments. An
average rate of potential change during the plateau is
0.2 V/s (0.3 V/s was estimated from Doerr et al), and
during phase-III repolarization, it is 2 V/s (2 V/s was
estimated from Doerr et al).

in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) during an action potential.
Once it is triggered (at 2 milliseconds), the junctional SR (JSR)
releases almost all of its free Ca2l contents (A) and most of the
buffered Ca2+ (calsequestrin [CSQN], B) into the myoplasm. Of
the released Ca2+ ions, 97.8% are buffered by troponin (TRPN)
and calmodulin (CMDN) in the myoplasm (D and E, respective-
ly), resulting in a peak free [Ca2+1] of only 1 ,umol/L (C). The
released Ca2+ ions reenter the network SR (NSR, F) and
translocate into JSR. For CSQN, 100% corresponds to buffering
of 10 mmol/L of [Ca2+]JSR; for TRPN, 100% corresponds to
buffering of 70 ,umol/L of [Ca2+J1; and for CMDN, 100% corre-
sponds to buffering of 50 1mol/L of [Ca2+],.

Figs 14 and 15 describe the processes that regulate
[Ca2+] in the cell. In Fig 14, cumulative Ca2' entry of
0.375 ,lmol/L 2 milliseconds from the onset of Vm.,
results in an increase of [Ca2+]i from 0.12 ,umol/L to
only 0.1235 ,mol/L, which is small due to the buffering
of Ca2' in the myoplasm. The Ca2+ entry triggers the
release of Ca21 ions from the JSR into the myoplasm
(Fig 14A and 14B) following the kinetics of the CICR
process. The total amount of Ca2+ ions released is 6.37
mmol/L (based on the small volume of the JSR), which
is equivalent to 45 ,umol/L in the large volume of the
myoplasm. The value of 6.37 mmol/L released by the
JSR is made up of 1.53 mmol/L of free Ca2' and 4.84
mmol/L of Ca2+ buffered by CSQN, demonstrating the
importance of buffering in the JSR to increase its Ca2+
storage capacity. Because of the large capacity buffers
in the myoplasm, 97.8% of the released Ca2+ ions are
buffered (71.7% by troponin and 26.1% by calmodulin),
resulting in a peak intracellular Ca2' transient of 1
gmol/L (Fig 14C). These simulated results demonstrate
the importance of the myoplasm buffers in maintaining
the low level of [Ca2+]j. Throughout the action poten-
tial, Ca21 ions enter the NSR by the uptake process,
increasing [Ca2,] in the NSR from 1.73 to 1.92 mmol/L
(Fig 14F). Fig 15 depicts the movement of Ca2+ ions
inside the cell. As indicated in Fig 15B, the Ca21 ions
are released from the JSR into the myoplasm as a spike
with a peak rate of 3 mmol/L per millisecond and then
reenter the NSR (Fig 15C) with a maximum uptake rate
of 2.6 gmol/L per millisecond, which is much greater

,umol/L per millisecond, resulting in a net loading of
Ca2' ions into the NSR as shown in Fig 14F. Finally, the
Ca' ions that loaded the NSR are translocated into the
JSR with a rate of 0.86 ,.mol/L per millisecond (Fig
15E); therefore, the Ca'2 content of the JSR increases,
as shown in Fig 14A and 14B.

Fig 16 shows the gating processes of the L-type Ca'
channel during an action potential. The d-gate is fully
activated at the onset of the action potential upstroke,
bringing ICa to its early peak value of -6.27 ,uA/,F.
Then, the increase of [Ca +]i inactivates 'Ca through the
Ca2'-dependent inactivation processes (fCa) from its
-3.3 ,uA/,uF. During the plateau (from
peak value to
10 to 160 milliseconds), ICa is determined by the increase
in the fca-gate (reflecting a decrease in [Ca]2+]) and a
decrease in the f-gate. Finally, during the late repolar-
ization phase, the d-gate is inactivated very early to
close the L-type Ca' channel during this phase. In Fig
17, the ionic currents through the L-type channel are
shown. The peak inward current of ICat (-3.74 ,A/,uF)
is smaller than that of 'Ca (-6.27 gA/tF) because of the
outward K+ current, 1CaK, whose peak value is 3.87
,uA/,F. By using the action potential clamp technique,
Doerr et a173 found that the ratio of peak to plateau
Ca>2 current is 1.39±0.5. In the model, this ratio for ICat
is 1.28, in the range of the measurements. (Note that ICa,t
is the current measured in the experiments.) There
exists a notch in lCa and ICa,t (arrows). This is due to the

mostly composed of the time-independent K' current (IK1, B)
and the plateau K' current (1KP, C); note that each of these
currents contributes during a different phase of the action
potential. The Na+-K+ pump (INaK, D) increases during depolar-
ization and pumps Na+ ions out of the cell throughout the
plateau. The Ca2+ pump in the sarcolemma (1p(Ca), E) extrudes
Ca2+ ions from the cell throughout the action potential (in
contrast, INaCa [Fig 19] operates to extrude Ca2+ mostly during
the late repolarization and early postrepolarization phases).
During the action potential plateau, the Nal background leakage
current (INab, F) and the Ca21 background leakage current (lc,b,
G) decrease monotonically because of the decrease of the
driving force. Currents shown in the figures are for 1 ,uF of
membrane capacitance.

in the phase-1 model. During the action potential
plateau, INaK (Fig 18D) increases because of the increase
of the membrane potential and extrudes Na+ ions that
entered the cell during the upstroke of the action
potential. Ip(Ca) (Fig 18E) helps INaCa to extrude Ca2' ions
out of the cell. The Na+ leakage INa,b and Ca2` leakage
ICa,b (Fig 18F and 18G) both decrease during the action
potential plateau because of the decrease of the driving
force. In Fig 19, we demonstrate the effect of INaCa on
the peak intracellular Ca2+ transient by clamping INaCa to
zero when INaCa>0 (the results under this condition are
marked by asterisks in the figure). As a result, the
cumulative Ca2' entry 2 milliseconds from the onset of
Vmax decreases from 0.375 to 0.3 gmol/L, and the peak
intracellular Ca2+ transient also decreases from 1.0 to
0.75 ,umol/L. Because the smaller peak intracellular
Ca2+ transient implies a reduced level of Ca2+-depen-
dent inactivation, 'Ca is relatively larger, and the plateau
potential is more positive.

Discussion

The goal of the present study was to construct a
model of the membrane action potential of the mam-
malian ventricular cell that was based on, whenever
possible, recent experimental studies in single-cell and
single-channel preparations and in other preparations
such as SR vesicles. Individual processes (eg, ionic

exchange current (INaCa) to the peak intracellular Ca2+ transient.
The fact that INaCa (C) is positive during the depolarization phase
implies influx of Ca2+ ions. This is in addition to the influx of Ca2+
through the L-type Ca2+ current (Ica). The resulting larger [Ca2+]
entry triggers a larger Ca2+ release by the junctional sarcoplas-
mic reticulum and a greater peak intracellular Ca2+ transient (B).
The larger [Ca2+J1 causes greater inactivation of lCa and some-
what decreased plateau action potentials (AP, A). Solid curves

currents) are formulated quantitatively on the basis of
experimental data and measured parameter values. The
objective was to integrate these components into a
model of the cell that could be used to demonstrate
possible interactions between these components and to
simulate the resulting qualitative cellular behavior. In
the first phase of this work,1 we reformulated five
membrane ionic currents: INa (fast Na+ inward current),
IK (time-dependent K+ current), 'K1 (time-independent
K+ current), 'Kp (plateau K+ current), and lb (back-
ground current). The phase-1 model retained the slow
inward current (I1i) of the B-R model and was used to
investigate physiological phenomena dominated by the
Na+ and K' currents listed above. These included
effects of changes in [K+]o on the action potential and
the response of the cell to stimulation and pacing during
the late repolarization and early postrepolarization
phases of the action potential. The phase-1 model
included only ionic currents through gated channels in
the sarcolemma. A major limitation of this model was its
inability to simulate dynamic changes in ionic concen-
trations during the action potential. The major thrust of
the work presented here (the phase-2 model) was to
incorporate such dynamic changes in the model. To do
so, we reformulated the Ca 2+ current through the
sarcolemma to be consistent with the most recent
experimental findings. We also incorporated currents
that are carried across the sarcolemma by processes
other than gated ionic channels, ie, pumps and exchang-
ers. Intracellular processes that dynamically regulate
[Ca 2+]i were also incorporated in the model. These
include Ca2+ uptake and release by the SR and buffer-
ing of Ca2+ in the myoplasm and in the SR. It should be
commented that the phase-2 model responded correctly

to all the physiological phenomena investigated by the
phase-1 model.

In 1985, DiFrancesco and Noble9 developed a dy-
namic model of the Purkinje action potential, which
included many of the processes that were incorporated
in the ventricular model presented here. The formula-
tion of the D-N model was limited by the experimental
data from single-cell and single-channel studies that
were available at the time. Therefore, important prop-
erties of the ionic currents and other processes were not
incorporated in the D-N model. This was discussed
briefly in our previous study.' Differences between the
D-N Purkinje model and the ventricular model pre-
sented here are explored further in the following dis-
cussion. In 1990, Rasmusson et al10 published an action
potential model for the frog atrial cell. This model is
very different from the ventricular model presented
here in that it does not include a representation of the
SR and its role in the dynamics of intracellular Ca`.
This is because Ca> fluxes into or out of the SR are
known to be very small in frog atrial cells under normal
conditions, and sufficient increase in [Ca>], to cause
contraction can be obtained through 'Ca alone. A de-
tailed discussion of the various components of the
phase-2 model developed in the present study and of
their ability to simulate physiological phenomena is
provided below.
lCa, the Ca` Current Through the L-Type
Ca` Channel

In the model, only the L-type (long-lasting) Ca>
channel was included. Another type of Ca2+ channel
exists in cardiac cells and is named the T-type channel
(ICaT) to emphasize its transient properties.97 1Ca,T could
be clearly identified, but there was only rather weak
evidence that this channel might be involved in the
regulation of rhythmic activity.98 Therefore, it was not
incorporated in our model. Compared with the kinetics
measured in tissue preparations, the kinetics of the
L-type channel measured in single-cell preparations
exhibit the following properties: (1) The activation is an
order of magnitude faster (the maximum time constant
is only 1 or 2 milliseconds as compared with =40
milliseconds in the B-R model2). (2) The maximum
conductance is an order of magnitude larger (0.09
millisiemens in the B-R model but 0.9 millisiemens in
our model). (3) Reversal potential and permeability
ratios between different ions are much better defined.
(4) Inactivation depends not only on the membrane
potential but also on [Ca2+]i. All of these properties are
incorporated in the model developed here. The first
three observations were made consistently in many
experiments in the 1980s; however, the last issue regard-
ing the kinetics of channel inactivation is still controver-
sial since the experimental data are not consistent, as
demonstrated in Fig 2. In particular, different charac-
teristics of the voltage-dependent inactivation f-gate
were measured in different experiments. We formulated
all of these different behaviors (Appendix 3) and used
the equations to simulate recent experiments that were
conducted in single ventricular cells under normal phys-
iological conditions. The simulations identified a par-
tial-U-shaped f. and a U-shaped rf10 as the best choice
that correctly duplicates the experimental behavior.
This procedure is an example that shows how the model

can be used as a tool for critical evaluation of the
conflicting experimental data.
Ca>` Fluxes in the SR

Fabiato30-32 suggested functional compartmentation
of SR into NSR and JSR but not structural compart-
mentation. However, in recent experiments, both func-
tional and structural compartmentation of SR could be
observed on the basis of these findings: (1) The Ca>2
loading rate of the JSR is negligible compared with that
of the NSR.27 (2) The loading rate of the JSR is
insensitive to ryanodine and ruthenium red, whereas
the loading rate of NSR is sensitive to these drugs.29 (3)
The Ca>2 buffer CSQN exists only in the JSR, not in the
NSR; therefore, the density of Ca>2 in the JSR is much
higher than that in the NSR.28 (4) By use of SR-stained
electron micrographs, JSR and NSR can be structurally
distinguished but appear contiguous.23'24 In our model,
SR is compartmentalized both functionally and struc-
turally. NSR, occupying 92% of SR volume, is respon-
sible for Ca> uptake, whereas JSR, occupying 8% of
SR volume, is responsible for Ca>2 release. For model-
ing the release channel of the JSR, we adopt a simple
time-dependent process described by an exponential
rise and fall.78,79 A release model based on the Hodgkin-
Huxley type formalism, presented by Wong et al,99 is not
adopted. This is because (1) its kinetics, obtained from
skinned cell preparations, is 100 times slower than that
in intact cardiac cells,42,79 (2) it does not simulate [Ca2+]i
wave propagation even when its kinetics is made faster
by a factor of 100,80 and (3) only functional compart-
mentation of SR is assumed in their model, and the
entire SR, as a single compartment, is responsible for
both Ca>2 release and uptake.

The amount of Ca> release in our model depends on
the cumulative Ca2+ entry into the cell 2 milliseconds
from the time of Vma,, or from the time of stimulus.42
This accounts for the dependence of Ca>2 release on the
rate of increase of [Ca 2+]i observed by Fabiato.31 Other
properties such as modification of the release channel
by H+, Na+, K+, and Mg 2+ are not incorporated in the
model, since there is no evidence that the concentra-
tions of these ions change significantly during the exci-
tation-contraction coupling cycle. The model ade-
quately describes the Ca 2+ fluxes and concentration
changes observed in whole-cell experiments42 under
normal conditions.
Ca2+ Buffers in the Myoplasm and in the JSR

Undoubtedly, without Ca2+ buffers in the myoplasm,
[Ca2+]i cannot be maintained at an appropriate low level
(maximum intracellular Ca2+ transient of x1 gmol/L),
and Ca2+ ions cannot be loaded appropriately into the
NSR when the cell is paced at fast frequencies. As
described in "Results," after the initiation of an action
potential, 45 gmol/L of Ca2+ ions were released by the
SR into the myoplasm. In the absence of buffers, [Ca2+]1i
would have increased from the resting level of 0.12 to
45.12 1£mol/L (compared with 1 ,umol/L in the presence
of buffers). This high level of [Ca2+]i would have en-
hanced the Ca2+-efflux mode of INaCa by a factor of 376
(=45.12/0.12). As a result, most of the released Ca2+
ions would have been extruded out of the cell during the
action potential plateau, resulting in intracellular Ca2+
transients that decrease to the resting value during the

plateau phase. In addition, the resulting high negative
amplitude of INaCa would have contributed significantly
to the plateau potentials, and INaCa would have been a
major determinant of the action potential plateau. This
is the behavior of INaCa in the D-N model9 for Purkinje
fibers, in which Ca2' buffers in the myoplasm were not
included. A decrease of [Ca2"]i to the resting value and
a major contribution of INaCa during the action potential
plateau are inconsistent with the experimental findings
in single ventricular cells.42,73"100 For example, Leblanc
and Hume'00 found that intracellular Ca2, transients do
not decrease or decrease with a very slow rate when the
membrane is depolarized in single ventricular cells.
Another serious consequence of the absence of buffers
is that the cell would have discharged most of its Ca'+
content during the action potential plateau because of
the enhanced INaCa. This is completely contradictory to
the experimental observation that myocytes can be
loaded with Ca2' by pacing. If a paced cell could not be
loaded with Ca21 ions, the phenomenon of postextra-
systolic inotropic potentiation, found in the experi-
ments, could not be observed.79,87 Therefore, without
Ca2' buffers in the model, not only is the behavior of
INaCa incorrect, but also, very important physiological
phenomena cannot be duplicated by the simulations.
buffer in the JSR, its role is
different from the buffers in the myoplasm. It increases
the capacity of the JSR to store Ca2
in a very small
volume. The volume of the JSR is only 0.48% of the cell
volume, whereas the volume fraction of the myoplasm in
the cell is 68%. In the resting state, the free Ca21
content of the JSR is 1.73 mmol/L, which is equivalent
to 12.2 gmol/L in the much larger volume of the
myoplasm. If the entire content of free Ca2
in the JSR
were released into the myoplasm, [Ca2+]i could have
only reached a level of 0.25 ,umol/L because of the
buffering process in the myoplasm. With the [CSQN]
buffer in the JSR, 6.84 mmol/L of Ca2+ ions are
buffered, resulting in a total Ca2+ content of 8.57
mmol/L at the resting state. Therefore, the storage
capacity of the JSR is increased by a factor of 5 because
of the presence of the buffer. This allows the JSR to
store sufficient Ca2+ ions that on release can bring the
peak intracellular Ca2, transient to z1 gmol/L and
cause muscle contraction.
Iv, the Total Time-Independent Current

Regarding the Ca2'

The total time-independent current, IK1(T), in the
phase-1 model is denoted here as Iv, a time-independent
current that depends only on voltage. This is because Iv
is not a pure K+ current and consists of INab, 'Cab, Ip(Ca)g
and INaK in addition to the K+ currents IK1 and IKP. The
protocol for measuring Iv is to apply a.slowly changing
voltage ramp.52 Therefore, the measured Iv definitely
includes INaCa in addition to the six currents listed above.
However, the amplitude of INaCa is greatly affected by
intracellular Ca2+ transients. This introduces a time-
dependent factor into Iv and disturbs its behavior as a
purely voltage-dependent current in our simulations. For
this reason, we did not include INaCa in Iv. I(ca) and ICa,b
are also dependent on the intracellular Ca + transient;
however, their amplitudes are very small compared with
IKi and IKp, which are the major components of Iv (Fig
18). Therefore, these currents do not introduce a signif-
icant time-dependent factor into Iv during the action

potential simulations. It should be mentioned that the
[K']o dependence of GK1 (and therefore of Iv) was not
formulated correctly in the D-N model, as we discussed
previously.' Similar comments apply to the model of
Rasmusson et al,10 since lKl of their model was adopted
from the D-N model. Also, both models do not incorpo-
rate the plateau K' channel, IKP
INaKI the Na+-K+ Pump

The activity of the pump is stimulated by [K'], and
[Na+]i and is dependent on the membrane potential.
The half-saturation concentrations for [K']. and [Na+]i
have been measured in many experiments,62,67-70
whereas the voltage dependence was elucidated only
recently by Nakao and Gadsby62 and Gadsby and Na-
kao.25 The voltage-dependence property was not incor-
porated in the D-N model, and the Gadsby and Nakao
data were not used by Rasmusson et al10 in their
formulation, since the data were not published at the
time. From the Na+ ion flux and the time constant of
INaK decay after exposure to zero [K']., Cohen et a166
concluded that the Hill coefficient of [Na+]i must be >3.
However, all other measurements61'68,69 obtain a value
<3. Therefore, a Hill coefficient of 1.5 is used in our
model, different from the values 3 and 1 used in the
Rasmusson model and in the D-N model, respectively.
The formulation simulates correctly the voltage depen-
dence of INaK for different values of [Na+]0 (Fig 9).
INaCa, the Na+-Ca2+ Exchanger

In recent experiments,53'54'92 the properties of [Na+]0
dependence, [Ca2+]0 dependence, and saturation at
very negative potentials of INaCa were clearly deter-
mined. These properties are incorporated in our formu-
lation of INaCa, which is modified from the formulation in
the D-N model. Also, the coefficient q=0.35 (position
of energy barrier) was measured quantitatively after the
D-N model was developed and is incorporated in our
model.53,5960,92 The new formulation predicts correctly
the voltage and ionic concentration dependence of INaCa
as measured in the experiments (Fig 10). This behavior
cannot be duplicated by the previous models. Note that
the scaling factor, kNaCa, is given in units of current
density (I£A/4F) and not in the units (,uA/[(mmol/
L)4 .uF]) used in the D-N model. Therefore, kNaCa in
our model is independent of the ionic concentrations.
Also, note that ksat=0.25 is used in Fig 10 to simulate the
measured property of INaCa saturation at very negative
potentials. However, we found that ksat=0.25 depressed
the Ca2`-efflux mode of INaCaso much that INaCa operated
to increase, rather than decrease, [Ca2+]. The large
degree of saturation in the measurements may be
caused by the nonphysiological environment of the cells
during the experiments. In one set of data measured by
Kimura et al"3 (ie, the curve of [Ca2+]0= 1 mmol/L in Fig
10), the amplitude of INaCa even decreases slightly at very
negative potentials. Therefore, in all simulations except
those of Fig 10, a smaller saturation factor (ksat=0.1)
was used.
Ins(Ca) the Nonspecific Ca2+-Activated Current

This channel was first identified and its properties
were measured quantitatively by Ehara et al,71 who used
single-channel recording techniques. In single-cell ex-
periments, a transient inward current (IT,) was observed

under conditions of Ca ` overload. However, it is un-
clear whether INaCa alone, Ins(Ca) alone, or both contribute
to ITI. By measuring the reversal potential of IT, or using
specific blockers for INaCa, several groups72"101 claim that
Ins(Ca) iS ITI, whereas other groups59 believe that INaCa is
ITI. Preliminary simulations using our model suggest
that ITI consists of both INaCa and Ins(ca) and that the
relative contribution of these two Ca2-activated cur-
rents to ITI depends on the conditions. However, this
prediction depends on our choice of a value for the
maximum conductance of Lns(Ca). The values provided by
Ehara et a171 are spread over an order of magnitude
(0.036 to 0.36 millisiemens/,F). Therefore, we deter-
mine the maximum conductance on the basis of the
effects of Ins(Ca) on the action potential, measured by
Doerr et al.73 With a maximum conductance of 0.072
millisiemens/,F, our simulated results duplicate the
measurements by Doerr et a173 (Fig 4). This value falls
in the range of values suggested by Ehara et al.71 The
ability to narrow down the possible range of conduc-
tances to one specific value is essential for a quantitative
study of the relative contributions of INaCa and Ins(Ca) to ITI
and of their role in arrhythmogenic activity of the single
cell (ie, afterdepolarizations and triggered activity).
IK, the Time-Dependent (Delayed-Rectifier)
K' Current

As clarified in "Materials and Methods," the refor-
mulation of ICa in the model dictated a reformulation of
IK. In the phase-1 model, 'K was formulated to depend
on the first power of the activation X-gate, similar to the
Beeler and Reuter2 formulation (the B-R IK). In the
model presented here, 'K was formulated to depend on
X2, as suggested by Matsuura et al,5' on the basis of
measurements in the single cell ('K of Matsuura et al).
Comparing the voltage dependence of these two cur-
rents, the higher degree of rectification of the B-R IK
results in plateau current at high positive potentials that
is 4.8 times smaller than that of IK of Matsuura et al.
This implies that IK of Matsuura et al can provide higher
repolarizing current and stronger capability of repolar-
izing the membrane from plateau potentials. As a result,
when introduced in the phase-2 model, the B-R IK fails
to repolarize the membrane adequately, and the action
potential displays an unrealistically long duration of 400
milliseconds at normal [K+]o=5.4 mmol/L. In contrast,
the large IK of Matsuura et al at plateau potentials
strongly repolarizes the membrane and results in a
realistic action potential duration of :180 milliseconds.
It should be noted that these results do not imply that a
high degree of rectification is not a correct property of
IK. It may depend on the species and the type of cell.
For example, the plateau potential (+17 mV) in the
B-R model is smaller than that (+30 mV) in the phase-2
model, and the plateau potentials of Purkinje fibers and
atrial cells can be <0 mV. For a low plateau potential,
IK of Matsuura et al becomes smaller than the B-R IK
because of its X2 kinetics, and the B-R IK provides more
current for repolarizing the membrane. Since the pla-
teau potential of mammalian ventricular cells (except
for the rat) is relatively high and positive, IK of Matsuura
et al provides more repolarizing current in these cells. It
should be commented that 'K in our model is relatively
large and therefore plays a major role in repolarization,
which is the case for the guinea pig-type ventricular

cell. For other species, including the rabbit, dog, and
rat, 'K is relatively small.

Note that the low degree of rectification of IK of
Matsuura et a151 results in a large degree of crossover
between current-voltage curves of different values of
[K'], (Fig 8). In contrast, the high degree of rectification
of the B-R IK results in a minimal crossover' (their Fig
1). It should be noted that the degree of crossover in our
model cannot be compared with that predicted by the
D-N model or the model of Rasmusson et al,10 simply
because the [K'], dependence of GK is not included in
these models. Finally, it should also be mentioned that
the characteristics and explanations of mechanisms un-
derlying physiological phenomena simulated by the
phase-i model' are independent of whether the B-R IK
or IK of Matsuura et al is used. This is because super-
normality and Wenckebach periodicity result from the
interaction between the slow recovery from inactivation
of IN, and postrepolarization refractoriness caused by a
slow decrease in the X-gate of IK. This property is
shared by both the phase-1 and phase-2 models.

Recently, Sanguinetti and Jurkiewicz102 have shown
that IK is composed of two overlapping currents, 'KS and
IK,r. In the present model, we do not separate 'K into its
components and maintain its global representation as
IK This approach is consistent with the focus of the
present study, namely, currents and processes that
determine intracellular Ca 2+ and depend on its concen-
tration. The simulations conducted here do not require
separation of 'K into 'KS and 'K,r and duplicate correctly
the global behavior of IK In a previous study,' we
investigated phenomena that involved IK in a major way,
such as supernormal excitability, Wenckebach period-
icity, and the effects of changes in [K'],. It will be
interesting, in future studies, to examine the separate
roles and relative importance of 'K, and IK,r in deter-
mining these cellular responses.
Electrophysiological Processes During the
Action Potential

The time course of ionic currents and concentration
changes during an action potential were described in
"Results" and depicted in Figs 13 through 19. It is clear
from the simulations that in spite of its fast activation
(relative to the B-R model), 'Ca does not contribute
significantly to the rising phase of the action potential.
However, the early peak of 'Ca is important, since it
determines the magnitude of early Ca2' entry into the
cell and, in turn, the release of Ca2 from the SR and
transient. It is interesting to note
the intracellular Ca2
that [Ca2]i inactivates ICa through the [Ca2'i-depen-
dent inactivation process (fca-gate in our formulation).
This suggests a negative-feedback control mechanism by
which the early 'Ca peak influences the inactivation of
1Ca. The intracellular Ca 2+ transient also influences
other currents, such as INaCa and, under certain condi-
tions, Ins(Ca). The simulations demonstrate the impor-
tance of buffering processes in the myoplasm in control-
ling cellular Ca2'
and, therefore, in regulating these
currents. A related observation is that INaCa does not
contribute significantly during most of the plateau but
influences the rate of membrane repolarization during
the repolarization phase and, consequently, the APD.
This simulated behavior is in agreement with the exper-
imental observation of Doerr et al.73 An important

limitation of the model is the assumption of intracellular
spatial uniformity, especially with regard to the distri-
bution of Ca`+ ions. The model assumes a uniform
distribution of Ca`+ buffers and of the SR. It does not
represent restricted diffusion of Ca`+ or the spatial
distribution of release sites from the JSR. This limita-
tion does not permit the simulation of spatially depen-
dent intracellular phenomena such as "Ca2+ waves" and
is likely to affect the time course of the Ca2
transient.
Representation of these spatial nonuniformities re-
quires detailed knowledge of the spatial distribution of
Ca2+ buffers and of release and uptake sites in the SR,
of the geometry and location of subcellular organelles,
of restricted spaces, and of diffusion barriers. Such
detailed structural information is not available, and the
complexity is beyond our modeling capabilities at pres-
ent. The implications of the spatial uniformity assump-
tion are discussed further in our accompanying article"
in relation to spontaneous Ca2' release by the SR and
the generation of delayed afterdepolarizations.
Summary and Conclusions

In summary, the work presented here is a second
phase in the development of an action potential model
for mammalian ventricular cells that is based, whenever
possible, on recent experimental findings. The model
can simulate dynamic changes in ionic concentrations.
The emphasis in this study is on ionic currents and other
processes that regulate and determine [Ca2+i] changes
during the action potential. Whereas these processes
constitute an important aspect of the electrical activity
of the cell and of generating the action potential, they
also determine the mechanical activity of the cell
through the excitation-contraction coupling process. In
our accompanying article," we use the model to study a
phenomenon that is related to excitation-contraction
coupling, namely postextrasystolic mechanical potenti-
ation.79,87 Another important aspect of the model is its

ability to simulate spontaneous release of Ca'+ from the
JSR when the cell is overloaded with Ca`+. This prop-
erty and the presence of a nonspecific Ca'+-activated
current (Ins(Ca)) in the model permit the study of arrhyth-
mogenic activity related to Ca'+ overload, such as
afterdepolarizations and triggered activity. These phe-
nomena are also simulated and investigated in the

several ionic currents were not included in the present
model. These include the transient outward current
(Ito), which will be incorporated in future models once
sufficient experimental data become available. Al-
though Ito is not observed in guinea pig ventricular cells
(of the type modeled here), it
is a very important
current for repolarization in ventricular cells of other
species (eg, dog, rabbit, and rat) and should be included
in models of the ventricular action potential in these
species. In addition, the T-type Ca'+ current (ICaT)97
and the Cl- current (IC1)103 were not included, since
experimental evidence suggests that they play a minimal
role under the conditions simulated here (eg, Ic, does
not play a significant role in the absence of adrenergic
stimulation).103 Other channels were not incorporated
in the model, since they do not contribute significantly
to the processes and phenomena investigated in the
present study. These include Ca'+-, ATP-, and Na+-
activated K' currents (IK(Ca),104 'K(ATP),105 and IK(Na),106
respectively). These channels may have to be included
in future models for the purpose of studying the effects
of ischemia and other abnormalities on the electrical
activity of the single cell. We would like to emphasize
that the model presented here for the mammalian
ventricular action potential is mostly based on the
guinea pig ventricular cell. However, it provides the
framework for modeling other types of ventricular cells,
with appropriate modifications made to account for
species differences.
