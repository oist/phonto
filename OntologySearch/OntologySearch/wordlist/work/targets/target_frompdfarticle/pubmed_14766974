It is becoming increasingly clear that bistability (or, more generally,
multistability) is an important recurring theme in cell signaling.
Bistability may be of particular relevance to biological systems that
switch between discrete states, generate oscillatory responses, or
‘‘remember’’ transitory stimuli. Standard mathematical methods al-
low the detection of bistability in some very simple feedback systems
(systems with one or two proteins or genes that either activate each
other or inhibit each other), but realistic depictions of signal trans-
duction networks are invariably much more complex. Here, we show
that for a class of feedback systems of arbitrary order the stability
properties of the system can be deduced mathematically from how
the system behaves when feedback is blocked. Provided that this
open-loop, feedback-blocked system is monotone and possesses a
sigmoidal characteristic, the system is guaranteed to be bistable for
some range of feedback strengths. We present a simple graphical
method for deducing the stability behavior and bifurcation diagrams
for such systems and illustrate the method with two examples taken
from recent experimental studies of bistable systems: a two-variable
Cdc2兾Wee1 system and a more complicated ﬁve-variable mitogen-
activated protein kinase cascade.

One of the most important and formidable challenges facing

biologists and mathematicians in the postgenomic era is to
understand how the behaviors of living cells arise out of the
properties of complex networks of signaling proteins. One inter-
esting systems-level property that even relatively simple signaling
networks have the potential to produce is bistability. A bistable
system is one that toggles between two discrete, alternative stable
steady states, in contrast to a monostable system, which slides along
a continuum of steady states (1–9). Early biological examples of
bistable systems included the lambda phage lysis-lysogeny switch
and the hysteretic lac repressor system (10–12). More recent
examples have included several mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) cascades in animal cells (13–15), and cell cycle regulatory
circuits in Xenopus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (16–18). Bistable
systems are thought to be involved in the generation of switch-like
biochemical responses (13, 14, 19), the establishment of cell cycle
oscillations and mutually exclusive cell cycle phases (17, 18), the
production of self-sustaining biochemical ‘‘memories’’ of transient
stimuli (20, 21), and the rapid lateral propagation of receptor
tyrosine kinase activation (22).

Bistability arises in signaling systems that contain a positive-
feedback loop (Fig. 1a) or a mutually inhibitory, double-
negative-feedback loop (which, in some regards, is equivalent to a
positive-feedback loop) (Fig. 1b). Indeed, Thomas (23) conjectured
that the existence of at least one positive-feedback loop is a
necessary condition for the existence of multiple steady states;
alternative proofs of this conjecture are given in refs. 24–27.
However, the existence of positive loops is far from being sufficient;
positive feedback does not guarantee bistability. A standard graph-
ical test, termed phase plane analysis, can be used to visualize under
what conditions a particular positive-feedback system will exhibit
bistability, but this test is valid only if the system contains no more

niques. (b) A two-component, mutually inhibitory feedback loop, which can also

than two variables. Realistic biological networks generally contain
more proteins and more variables (e.g., Fig. 1c), precluding the use
of phase plane analysis.

Here, we present a method for analyzing positive-feedback
systems of arbitrary order for the presence of bistability or multi-
stability (i.e., more than two alternative stable steady states),
bifurcation, and associated hysteretic behavior, subject to two
conditions that are frequently satisfied even in complicated, realistic
models of cell signaling systems: monotonicity and existence of
steady-state characteristics (28–34). The main ideas of this article
can be illustrated through two examples drawn from recent exper-
imental studies: the Cdc2-cyclin B兾Wee1 system, which can be
considered to be a two-variable system, and the Mos兾MAPK kinase
p42 MAPK cascade, a five-variable system.
A Two-Variable Example: The Cdc2-Cyclin B兾Wee1 System
As a first example, we will use our methods to determine the
stability behavior and bifurcation diagram for a two-variable
double-negative or mutually inhibitory feedback loop (Fig. 1b).
Of course, this example can be treated without recourse to our
theoretical developments, because it is generally straightforward
to derive results for 2D systems through classical phase plane
analysis (see Supporting Text, which is published as supporting
information on the PNAS web site, for further discussion of the
present method vs. phase plane analysis for two-variable sys-
tems). But precisely because it is possible to visualize phase plane
behavior, the example affords us a way to compare our frame-
work with classical approaches.

To put the example into concrete terms, we suppose that one of
the proteins is the Cdc2-cyclin B complex, and the other is the Wee1
protein (Fig. 2a) (17, 18, 35–38), and we make a number of
simplifications to allow the interplay between Cdc2-cyclin B and
Wee1 to be treated as a two-variable problem. First, we assume that
Cdc2-cyclin B and Wee1 each exist in only two forms (rather than

multiple forms, as is actually the case): an active form (with x1
denoting active Cdc2 and y1 denoting active Wee1) and an inactive
form (x2 and y2 denoting inactive Cdc2 and Wee1, respectively).
Second, we assume that the phosphorylations of Cdc2 and Wee1
are reversed by some constitutively active phosphatases (which
ignores the contribution of Cdc25 regulation to the bistability of the
Cdc2 system). Finally, we assume that the inhibition of each kinase
by the other is approximated by a Hill equation. The equations for
this model system are:

The ␣s and ␤s are rate constants; the Ks are Michaelis (saturation)
constants; the ␥s are Hill coefficients; and v is a coefficient that
reflects the strength of the influence of Wee1 on Cdc2-cyclin B, in
control-theory terms, the ‘‘gain’’ of the system. (One could also
define the gain of this feedback loop as ⭸x1兾⭸y1, or alternatively as
⭸ ln x1兾⭸ ln y1; all three measures provide a sense of the strength of
the inhibition of Cdc2 by Wee1.) If we take x2 ⫽ 1 ⫺ x1 and y2 ⫽
1 ⫺ y1 (that is, assume that the total concentrations of Wee1 and
Cdc2-cyclin B are unchanging and measure concentrations in
fractional terms), we can eliminate two variables from these equa-
tions and simplify them, yielding system 1:

inputs and outputs. An outline of this theory is provided in
Supporting Text; proofs and details can be found elsewhere (28, 29).
The key to our approach is to view system 1 as a feedback closure
of the following open-loop system (2) in which the variable ␻is seen
as an input or ‘‘stimulus’’ variable, and ␩ ⫽ y1 is the output or
‘‘response’’ variable:

In other words, we analyze the system by ‘‘breaking’’ the feedback

manipulated (Fig. 3 a), and only later, after analyzing the behavior
of output ␩as a function of input ␻, do we reclose the loop by letting

Phase Plane Diagrams for the Cdc2-Cyclin B兾Wee1 System,
Deduced from Numerical Simulations
We can then choose values for the constants ␣, ␤, ␬, ␥, and v, and
numerically compute the time evolution of x1 and y1 for various
choices of their initial values. As shown in Fig. 2b, when v ⫽ 1, the
system exhibits bistability, with two attracting steady states, a high
Cdc2-cyclin B-activity state (M phase-like) and a high Wee1 activity
state (interphaselike), that essentially compete for trajectories. For
values of v ⬎ ⬇1.8, only the low Cdc2-cyclin B兾high Wee1 state
persists (Fig. 2c), and the system changes from bistable to monos-
table. Likewise, for v ⬍ ⬇0.83, only the high Cdc2-cyclin B兾low
Wee1 state is present (Fig. 2d).
Global Stability Analysis of the Cdc2-Cyclin B兾Wee1 System:
The Open-Loop Approach
We will next explain how the bistability of the system at interme-
diate values of v, as well as the bifurcation diagram, can be deduced
from the general theoretical framework presented in this article.
This framework draws on the theory of monotone systems with

Two critical properties are necessary for our methodology to
apply, and they must be verified before the application of our
theorem. These properties can be summarized as follows: (A) the
open-loop system has a monostable steady-state response to con-
stant inputs [we then say that the system has a well-defined
steady-state input兾output (I兾O) characteristic]; and (B) there are
no possible negative feedback loops, even when the system is closed
under positive feedback (we then say that the system is strongly I兾O
monotone).

Property A means that, for each constant-in-time input signal
␻(t) ⬅ a for t ⬎ 0 (i.e., a step-function input stimulus), and for any
initial conditions x1(0), y1(0), the solution of the system of differ-
ential equations (2) converges to a unique steady state (which
depends on the particular step magnitude a, but not on the initial
states). When this property holds, we write kx,y(a) to indicate the
steady-state vector limt
3⫹⬁[x1(t), y1(t)] corresponding to the signal
␻(t) ⬅ a, and k␩(a) to indicate the corresponding asymptotic value
␩(⫹⬁) for the corresponding output signal.

One of the main steps in verifying the applicability of our analysis
method to a particular system is that of checking that this property
is satisfied. To a biochemist, property A might seem self-evident.
However, it is not trivial to prove it rigorously, even for systems of
differential equations that describe relatively simple signaling net-
works. In the example of the MAPK cascade treated later in this
article, we appeal to a theorem proved in ref. 29 to establish this fact.
But for system 2, it is straightforward to verify the condition. For any
constant input ␻, k␩(␻) ⫽ ␩(⫹⬁) ⫽ y1(⫹⬁) is given by the following
formula:

␣2共K2 ⫹ 共␣1共K1 ⫹ ␻␥

This function has a single value for every value of ␻; a plot of k␩ is
shown in Fig. 3c (red curve). Note the sigmoidal character of the
curve, which is caused by our having assumed that ␥1, ␥2 ⬎1. This
assumption will be critical for bistability.

The second of the properties to be verified before applying our
theoretical results, property B (monotonicity), refers to the graph-
ical structure of the interconnection among the dynamic variables.
To make it precise, we introduce the incidence graph of a system,
as follows (see Fig. 6, which is published as supporting information
on the PNAS web site). For a system with n variables pi, the
incidence graph has n ⫹ 2 nodes (so, in the example in Eq. 2, where
n ⫽ 2, there are four nodes). The nodes are labeled ␻, ␩, and pi, i ⫽
1, . . . , n. A labeled edge (an arrow with a ⫹ or ⫺ sign attached to
it) is drawn whenever a variable pi (or input ␻) affects directly the
rate of change of a variable pj (or the value of the output), and a sign
is attached to each label: a ⫹ sign whenever the effect is positive
and ⫺ if the effect is negative. If the effect is ambiguous, because
the sign of its effect depends on the actual values of the input or
state variables, then our method does not apply.
For our example 2, the graph is shown in Fig. 3b. The negative
arrow ␻3
represents the fact that the function ␣1(1 ⫺ x1) ⫺
␤1x1␻␥
1) in the first of the equations (2), which determines
the rate of change of x1, is a decreasing function of ␻; i.e., ␻inhibits
x1. The same holds for the influence of x1 on y1 (Eq. 2). On the other
hand, the choice of output ␩⫽ y1 is represented by a positive arrow.
Autocatalytic or degradation effects (self-loops) are not reflected
in the graph: for example, the decay term ⫺␣1x1 in the first equation
makes the rate of change of x1 be smaller if x1 is greater, but it is not
included in the graph.

1兾(K1⫹␻␥

Given any path in an incidence graph (such as the path ␻, x1, y1
in the graph shown in Fig. 3b), we define its sign as the product of
the signs along the path (in the example, the sign of ␻, x1, y1 is
positive, being the product of two negatives). We say that a path is
positive or negative depending on its sign.

The property of monotonicity that we need amounts to checking
these requirements: (i) every loop in the graph, directed or not, is

positive; (ii) all of the paths from the input to the output node are
positive; (iii) there is a directed path from the input node to each
node pi; and (iv) there is a directed path from each pi to the output
node. Note that i together with ii amounts to the requirement that
every possible loop is positive, even after closing under any positive
feedback. Properties iii and iv are technical conditions needed for
mathematical reasons.

For our example, i is automatically verified (there are no loops),
and ii–iv are obvious from the graph shown in Fig. 3b. Thus both
the prerequisite conditions A and B are satisfied for the example
system (2), and our method can be applied.

The next step consists of graphing together the characteristic k␩,
which represents the steady-state output ␩ as a function of the
constant input ␻(Fig. 3c, red line), with the diagonal ␩⫽ ␻, which
represents ␻as a function of (Fig. 3c, blue line). Algebraically, this
amounts to looking for fixed points of the mapping k␩. We find that
there are three intersections between these graphs, which we will
refer to as points I, II, and III, respectively. At each of the three
points of intersection, we consider the slope of the characteristic k
and ask whether the slope is greater than unity or not. We see from
the picture that this slope is ⬍1 at I and III and ⬎1 at II.

Our theorem then concludes as follows. First, in the state-space
of the closed-loop system (1), which is obtained by writing ␻⫽ ␩⫽
y1 in the system 2, there are three steady states, let us call them xI,
xII, and xIII, respectively, corresponding to the I兾O pairs associated
to the points I, II, and III. Second, the states xI and xIII, which
correspond to the points at which the characteristic has slope ⬍1,
are attracting (that is to say, stable) steady states, whereas xII is
unstable. Finally, we can conclude that every trajectory, except
possibly for an exceptional set of zero measure, converges to either
xI or xIII. Clearly, these conclusions are consistent with the phase
plane shown in Fig. 2b, which shows two stable states, whose
domains of attraction span the whole positive orthant (with the
exception of the separatrix corresponding to the stable manifold of
the unstable state, a saddle). This is not only true for a simple
two-component system like the one illustrated in Eq. 1, but also for
any n-component system satisfying our monotonicity and open-
loop steady-state response assumptions.

Note that if the characteristic k␩ had not been sigmoidal (if we
had assumed both of the Hill coefficients to be 1 or less) there could
not be three intersections, and the system could not be bistable at
any feedback strength. This finding suggests an experimental ap-
proach to the detection of bistability in positive-feedback systems.
If the feedback can be blocked in such a system, and if the
feedback-blocked system is known (or correctly intuited) to be
monotone, then if the experimentally determined steady-state
stimulus兾response curve of the feedback-blocked system is sigmoi-
dal, the full feedback system is guaranteed to be bistable for some
range of feedback strengths. Conversely, if the open-loop system
exhibits a linear response, a Michaelian response, or any response
that lacks an inflection point, the feedback system is guaranteed to
be monostable despite its feedback. Thus, some degree of ‘‘coop-
erativity’’ or ‘‘ultrasensitivity’’ is essential for bistability in mono-
tone systems of any order.
The bifurcation diagram for the Cdc2-cyclin B兾Wee1 system, a
plot of the possible steady states as a function of the feedback
strength v, can be determined from the properties of the open-loop
system as well. To do this, we study the effect of a feedback law ␻⫽
v ⫻ ␩ which amounts to intersecting the characteristic k␩ with
lines ␩ ⫽ (1兾v)␻, as shown in Fig. 3d for v ⫽ 0.83 and v ⫽ 1.8.
Observe that, for v ⬍ ⬇0.83 there is only one intersection (a high
Cdc2-cyclin B, low Wee1 state), and for v ⬎ ⬇1.8 there will again
be just one intersection (a low Cdc2-cyclin B, high Wee1 state) (Fig.
3d, dashed lines). In both cases, our theorem predicts a unique
globally asumptotically stable steady state in the full system, con-
sistently with the phase planes corresponding to v ⫽ 1.9 and v ⫽ 0.75
shown, respectively, in Fig. 2 c and d. In the intermediate range,
there will be three intersections, one associated with an unstable

diagonal, find three intersection points, and classify the three
associated steady states of the system according to the slopes at the
intersection. Because there are two intersections with slope ⬍1 and
one with slope ⬎1, we conclude (erroneously, as it turns out) that
there are two stable steady states, to which all trajectories (except
for those in the stable manifold of the one unstable state) converge.
This conclusion is totally false, as evidenced by the phase plane of
the system, shown in Fig. 4b. Trajectories do not converge to one
of two stable states, as expected for a bistable system. In fact, the
system has no stable steady states, and there is instead a limit cycle
oscillation. The failure of the system to exhibit the ‘‘expected’’
bistability is due to the fact that the system is not monotone. As
shown by its incidence graph (Fig. 4c), the loop x, y, x is negative.

The Modularity of Monotone Systems
One approach to complex cell signaling networks is to divide the
network into subsystems or modules of a more tractable size and
hope that the behavior of the entire system can be deduced from
the behaviors of these modules (39, 40). However, in real biological
networks there are interconnections between modules, and under
such circumstances there is no general guarantee that the behavior
of an isolated module will bear any resemblance to the behavior of
the module in its natural context. Thus, although modularity
remains a potentially important and highly desirable property of cell
signaling networks, it is not certain whether modularity is rare or
commonplace.

However, it is straightforward to show that any cascade com-
posed of subsystems, each of which is monotone and admits a
well-defined characteristic, will itself be monotone and admit a
characteristic (28, 29). Thus, there is an intrinsic modularity to
monotone systems, which is important both conceptually and in
terms of devising approaches to the dissection of complex signaling
systems. We make use of this modularity in the example that
follows.
A Modular, Five-Variable Example: The Mos兾MEK兾p42
MAPK Cascade
Here, we use our approach to analyze a higher dimensional system
drawn from the experimental literature. The system is a three-tier
MAPK cascade, based on the Mos兾MEK1兾p42 MAPK cascade
present in Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 5a). This particular MAPK
cascade was chosen for several reasons: the cascade is known to be
embedded in a positive-feedback loop (41–43) and to exhibit
bistability (13, 21); all of the relevant protein abundances and some
of the important kinetic parameters have been measured (44–46);
and experimental studies have been performed on the cascade both
as a closed-loop system (the normal situation) and an open-loop
system (where the feedback from p42 MAPK to Mos has been
blocked) (13, 47).

The key features of the cascade are shown schematically in Fig.
5a. Active Mos (x) accumulates based on a balance between
synthesis and degradation and can activate MEK through phos-
phorylation of two residues (converting unphosphorylated y1 to
monophosphorylated y2 and then bisphosphorylated y3). Active
MEK then phosphorylates p42 MAPK (z1) at two residues, result-
ing in p42 MAPK activation. Active p42 MAPK (z3) can then
promote Mos synthesis, completing the closed positive-feedback
loop. In addition, each of the phosphorylation reactions is opposed
by an unregulated dephosphorylation reaction. Details on the
rationale behind this model and the assumed protein abundances
and kinetic constants are provided in Supporting Text and Table 1,
which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site.
We mathematically model the dynamics of the cascade by means
of a system of seven differential equations (cf. refs. 47 and 48), using
x(t) to denote the concentration of Mos at time t, y1(t) to denote the
concentration of unphosphorylated MEK at time t, and so on, as
illustrated in Fig. 5a (see Supporting Text for the equations). We will
view this system as the closure under feedback ␻ ⫽ vz3 of the

state and the others with stable states. Thus, one recovers the
complete bifurcation diagram (Fig. 3d) from the graph of the I兾O
steady-state characteristic, not using numerical methods, and even
if no detailed mathematical model is available.

Finally, the hysteretic behavior of the system can be deduced
from Fig. 3d: increasing v from low to high results in picking the
lower branch in the bistable regime, whereas decreasing from high
to low takes us on the upper branch.

Monotonicity Is Needed
We should emphasize that the monotonicity assumption B is
absolutely essential for the validity of our results. The conclusion
that stable states will be in a one-to-one correspondence with points
at which the steady-state I兾O characteristic intersects the diagonal
␩⫽ ␻with slope ⬍1 is, in general, false. To illustrate the need for
monotonicity, let us consider the following example. We take the
system described by these equations (4):

x˙ ⫽ x共⫺x ⫹ y兲,

y˙ ⫽ 3y冉⫺x ⫹ c ⫹

with output ␩ ⫽ y. This system models a situation in which two
proteins x and y, whose concentrations are denoted by x(t) and y(t),
respectively, interact as follows. Protein x can be degraded when it
is dimeric (hence the ⫺x2 term in the first differential equation), and
its formation is promoted by protein y (term xy). Protein y is
degraded by x (term ⫺xy in the second equation) and its synthesis
is driven by cooperative autocatalysis (positive feedback of y upon
itself, last term). The state space on which this system evolves is the
positive orthant (x ⬎0 and y ⬎0). This is an activator兾inhibitor
system and corresponds to a predator–prey system from population
biology and ecology. To apply our methodology, we view the system
as the unitary feedback system that results from setting ␻⫽ ␩⫽ y

erty A is satisfied. Next, monotonicity needs to be verified. This is
trivial for the first subsystem, whose incidence graph is shown in Fig.
5b. For each of the two 2D subsystems (the dual phosphorylation
of MEK and the dual phosphorylation of p42 MAPK) the incidence
graph is more complicated, but again the monotonicity of these
subsystems can be inferred by inspection (Fig. 5b and Supporting
Text). Because each subsystem in the cascade is monotone, the
entire cascade is guaranteed to be monotone as well, and property
B is satisfied. Thus, all our theoretical considerations can be applied
to the system described by Eq. 6.
Next, we numerically calculate the steady-state I兾O characteris-
tic, k␩, for the model system. As shown in Fig. 5c, the curve is steeply
sigmoidal, similar in shape to a Hill equation curve with a Hill
coefficient of 5. In our model the sigmoidal character of the
characteristic arises mostly from the assumed nonprocessive dual
phosphorylation mechanisms for MAPK and MEK activation (49,
50). As described in Supporting Text, the parameters for the model
were chosen to reproduce the experimentally observed sigmoidal
relationship for MAPK activity as a function of Mos concentration
in an open-loop (feedback-blocked) system (47), lending confi-
dence that the I兾O characteristic curve for the Mos兾MEK兾p42
MAPK system is, in fact, sigmoidal, as it is in our model.

Accordingly, we can deduce the global stability behavior of the
entire five-dimensional system from a plot of the characteristic k␩,
and the line ␻ ⫽ vz3. Under unitary feedback (v ⫽ 1), the system
has three steady states (Fig. 5c), and our theoretical framework
allows us to conclude that the middle one is unstable and the high
and low states are stable. Moreover, every trajectory (except for a
zero-measure separatrix corresponding to the stable manifold of
the unstable steady state) must necessarily converge to one of the
two stable states.

We will now use our methodology to analyze this system. The first
step is to view system 6 as a cascade of three modular subsystems:
the 1D x (Mos) system, whose input is ␻and output is x; the 2D y1,
y3 (MEK) system, whose input is x and output is y3; and the 2D z1,
z3 (MAPK) system, whose input is y3 and output is z3.
It is straightforward to see that the first (Mos) level of the cascade
admits a well-defined I兾O characteristic, and in refs. 28 and 29 it was
proved that the MEK and MAPK subsystems do as well; thus, the
entire cascade admits a well-defined I兾O characteristic, and prop-

The mathematically proven bistability of the MAPK cascade
model can be illustrated through numerical simulations. We chose
11 sets of initial conditions for system 6 and solved the differential
equations numerically (under unity feedback). Fig. 5f shows the
time evolution of three of the variables (x, the concentration of Mos;
y3, the concentration of active MEK; and z3, the concentration of
active MAPK). As required by our theorem, all of the variables
funnel into one of two discrete, five-dimensional stable steady
states: an ‘‘on-state’’ (with most of the Mos and MAPK active and
about half of the MEK active) and an ‘‘off-state’’ (with very low
concentrations of active Mos, MEK, and MAPK).
If the feedback gain is not necessarily equal to one, we obtain the
stability behavior of the system by intersecting the I兾O character-
istic with the line of slope 1兾v. The result is that the system is
monostable when v is ⬍⬇0.7 (the on-state vanishes) or when v is
very large (the off-state vanishes) and is bistable for any value of v
in between. Therefore, the bistability of this model system is a fairly
robust function of the feedback gain.

Experimental Studies
One key question is whether the Mos兾MEK兾p42 MAPK cascade
actually does exhibit a sigmoidal stimulus response curve, resem-
bling the characteristic k␩ of the model system, when feedback is
blocked. If it does, and if the system really is monotone (as is true
for the model), then it is mathematically guaranteed that the
closed-loop system will be bistable for some range of feedback
strengths, irrespective of the exact details and parameters of the
system. Experimental data are not yet available for the complete
open-loop system (the experiment is difficult to perform), but data
are available for the response of p42 MAPK to different concen-
trations of Mos in the absence of feedback (47). The steady-state
activity of p42 MAPK as a function of the concentration of added
recombinant Mos was found to be steeply sigmoidal (Fig. 5d), and
the model agrees well with the experimental data (Fig. 5d, line).
The steeply sigmoidal shape for the open-loop Mos兾p42 MAPK
curve supports the notion that the closed-loop feedback system
should exhibit bistability, and indeed there is ample experimental

evidence that when feedback is permitted, this system does exhibit
a bistable response (13).

More Complicated Types of Feedback
Thus far we have analyzed systems where the output feeds back
directly to the input. More complicated feedback loops may also be
studied by using the same basic approach, by a reduction to unity
feedback. This is discussed further in Supporting Text and Fig. 7,
which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site.

Summary
We have shown that for a large class of biological positive-feedback
systems of arbitrary order it is possible to determine whether the
system exhibits bistability, bifurcations, and hysteretic stimulus兾
response relationships mathematically, without recourse to exten-
sive numerical simulations. This analysis can be implemented as a
simple graphical method: a characteristic curve (for the open-loop
system) and a straight line (which essentially equates the input of the
open-loop system with the output) are plotted on one set of axes;
the intersection points determine the steady states of the system;
and the relative slopes of the two lines at the intersection points
determine the stability of the steady states. Moreover, this same
type of analysis can be implemented as an experimental program:
if it is possible to measure the steady-state I兾O relationship for a
feedback loop under conditions where the feedback is blocked (e.g.,
by inhibitors, small interfering RNAs, or other experimental ma-
nipulations), and it can be demonstrated or safely assumed that the
system is monotone, then the system’s stability behavior can be
rigorously inferred from the shape of the I兾O curve, irrespective of
the details of the biochemical mechanism that led to produced the
curve. Our hope is that this method will help us to analyze and
understand the mechanistic basis of important systems-level bio-
logical behaviors.
