ON THE EFFECT OF THE INTRACELLULAR
CALCIUM-SENSITIVE K+ CHANNEL IN THE BURSTING

Based on the observation that the calcium-activated K+ channel in the pancreatic islet cells can also be
ABSTRACT
activated by the membrane potential, we have formulated a mathematical model for the electrical activity in the
pancreatic fl-cell. Our model contains two types of ionic channels, which are active above the subthreshold glucose
concentration in the limit-cycle region: a Ca2"-activated, voltage-gated K+ channel and voltage-gated Ca2" channel.
Numerical simulation of the model generates bursts of electrical activity in response to a variation of kc., the rate
constant for sequestration of intracellular calcium ions. The period and duration of the bursts in response to kca are in
good agreement with experiment. The model predicts that (a) a combined spike and burst pattern can be created using
only single species of inward and outward currents, (b) the inactivation kinetics (i.e., h) in the inward current is not a
necessary condition for the generation of the pattern, and (c) a given pattern or intensity of electrical activity may
produce different levels of intracellular Ca2" depending on the set of certain electrical parameters.

INTRODUCTION

The cells in the pancreas that secrete insulin are called
(3-cells. They are situated in tightly associated cellular
aggregates known as the islets of Langerhans. One of the
most interesting properties of the fl-cell is its ability to
exhibit a characteristic electrical activity when glucose is
added in the perfusion medium (Dean and Mathews, 1970;
Ribalet and Beigleman, 1979; Atwater et al., 1980). In the
presence of low glucose concentration (i.e., below 5 mM),
the voltage across the plasma membrane of the f-cell
remains at the resting level of -68 mV (Ashcroft et al.,
1984). When the glucose concentration is raised above
-5.5 mM, however, the membrane potential displays the
burst activity. This consists of an active phase during which
spikes are generated and a silent phase during which the
membrane is hyperpolarized. The burst activity continues
until the glucose level reaches - 16.6 mM. Characteristics
of the electrical burst, which change appreciably as glucose
increases, are the relative duration of the active phase and
the burst period; increasing glucose increases the relative
duration of the active phase (Beigelman et al., 1977;
Meissner and Pressler, 1980; Atwater et al., 1980), while
the burst period decreases at first but starts to increase
near the glucose saturation level (i.e., 16.5 mM) (Meissner
and Schmelz, 1974; Beigelman et al., 1977). In high
glucose concentrations (i.e., above 16.6 mM), the burst
pattern disappears and spike activity becomes continuous.
Simultaneous measurements of electrical activity in
impaled fl-cells and insulin release from the corresponding
islets (Atwater et al., 1979; Scott et al., 1981) have shown

that insulin is released from the f-cell during these bursts.
The insulin release rate has a periodicity close to that of the
burst of electrical activity. The mechanism involved in the
regulation of insulin release has been the subject of exten-
sive investigation.

A large body of evidence suggests that the cytosolic
calcium ionic concentration, [Ca2+]i, regulates insulin
release. Using the intracellular trapped fluorescent Ca2+
indicator quin2, Rorsman et al. (1984) have shown that
glucose stimulates an increase of the cytosolic free Ca2+
concentration in adult noninbred obese-f-cells. Also, Woll-
heim and Pozzan (1984) have given direct experimental
evidence that in suspension of RINm5F, secretagogue-
induced insulin release was accompanied by a rise in
[Ca2,] . Thus, how [Ca2+]i changes in response to glucose
and how the electrical activity controls the level of [Ca2+]i
seem to be a key to understand the insulin release mecha-
nism.

The Ca2+-activated K+ channel is believed to be an
important link between [Ca2+]i and the bursting electrical
activity (Atwater et al., 1979; Petersen and Maruyama,
1984). Based on the existence of this channel and also on
evidence that the fl-cell possesses both the voltage-gated
K+ channel (Ribalet and Beigelman, 1979) and the volt-
age-gated Ca2, channel (Matthews and Sakamoto, 1975;
Atwater et al., 1980), Chay and Keizer (1983) have
proposed a mathematical model for the bursting phenome-
non in the electrical activity of the f-cell. This model
consists of the following: a potassium channel with a
conductance that is activated by the binding of intracellu-
lar Ca2+; Hodgkin-Huxley-like conductances for K+ and

Ca2" (Ca2" replaces Na+ in the Hodgkin-Huxley model);
and a sink for intracellular Ca2" stores, possibly mitochon-
dria, which is activated by glucose (Rorsman et al., 1984).
The glucose dependence in the Chay-Keizer model comes
in through the rate constant of the efflux of Cal.

The advent of the patch-clamp technique for studying
the properties of single ionic channels have made possible
to characterize a high-conductance K+ channel, which is
activated by intracellular Ca2" ions (Cook et al., 1984;
Findlay et al., 1985b) and a low-conducatance K+ channel
that is inhibited by a metabolite of glucose (i.e., ATP) and
has therefore been called the ATP-inhibited K+-channel
(Cook and Hales, 1984; Ashcroft et al., 1984; Findlay et
al., 1985a). The low-conductance K+-channel is insensitive
to membrane potential and Cai (Findlay et al., 1985a), but
could be inhibited a glucose concentration 10 mM (Ash-
croft et al., 1984). The experiments of Cook et al. (1984)
and Findlay et al. (1985b), on the other hand, reveal that
the high-conductance K+ channels in the islet cells can be
activated by both membrane potential and cytosolic Ca2"
ions. The "open probability" of their K+ channel suggests
further that the voltage-sensitive K+ channel, which is
believed to exist in the fl-cell (Atwater et al., 1979), is
indeed the high-conductance Cat-sensitive K+ channel, i.e.
the V-gated K+ channel and Cai-sensitive K+ channels are
identical.

In this paper, we modify the Chay-Keizer model (which
assumes the existence of two separate K+ channels) and
demonstrate that a Ca1-sensitive K+ channel that is acti-
vated by membrane potential, along with a voltage-gated
Ca2" channel, is sufficient to produce the observed steady
state bursts of the d-cell electrical activity.

MODEL

In the f-cell, the total ionic current consists of a calcium
current, potassium current, and leak current. There are
two types of potassium currents: the ATP-inhibited K+
current IK,ATP and the Cai-sensitive K+ current IK,Ca* In the
resting state, IK,ATP in the f-cell dominates the resting-cell
K+ permeability (Aschcroft et al., 1984), and this current
is primarily responsible for the resting membrane potential
of about - 70 mV. At this low potential, there is essentially
no current flowing through Ca2+-activated K+ channels
and also voltage-gated Ca2` channels. Addition of glucose
results in an inhibition of ATP-inhibited K+ channels,
which in turn gives rise to ICa and IKCa. Thus, above 5 mM
of glucose concentration, IKATP is not operative in the
steady state (private communication with Dr. B. Ribalet),
the outward current is primarily due to IK,Ca, and the
inward current is exclusively carried by Ca2` ions through
the V-gated Ca2` channel. It should be emphasized here
that IK,ATP is quite significant in the initial transient state
(first 2-3 min after addition of glucose). Our model is
concerned with the bursting "limit-cycle" regime, where
IK,ATP is negligible (i.e., 15 min or so after addition of 5 mM
or higher glucose concentration).

In terms of a Hodgkin-Huxley-like circuit model, the
dynamics of the membrane potential V of such a system
may be written as

47rr Cm dV/dt = Ica + IKCa + IL,

(1)
where Cm is the membrane capacitance, r is the radius, and
ICa' IK,Ca' and IL are, respectively, the voltage-gated cal-
cium channel current, the Cai- and V-sensitive K+ channel
current, and the leak current. The leak current includes the
currents due to the electrogenic pumps (e.g. Na/K and
Ca-ATPase pumps) and the electrogenic exchange carrier
systems (e.g., Na/Ca exchanger).

The ionic current carried by X ions may be expressed by
a driving force multiplied by its conductance. The driving
force is the difference between the membrane potential
and reversal potential, which is the voltage at which no net
current flows through the channel

Ix = gx (Vx-V),

(2)
where X stands for K+, Ca2+, and leak ions, gx is the
conductance of X ions, and Vx is the reversal potential. The
reversal potential for X ion can be conveniently expressed
by the Nernst equation of the following form:

Vx = RT/ZxF In ([X]0/ [X]i),

(3)
where Zx is the charge of X ion, RT carries its usual
meaning, F is the Faraday constant, [X]0 and [X]i are the
X ionic concentrations for the extracellular and intracellu-
lar spaces, respectively. Since the concentrations of leak
ions in the two phases are not known, we simply take VL to
be constant.

A single channel conductance is a measure of the
permeability of X ions through a channel that permits X
ions to pass through. It is equal to the total cell conduc-
tance gx in Eq. 2 divided by the number of the channels.
This channel consists of protein molecules whose rear-
rangements are responsible for the changes in conduc-
tance. The kinetics of the molecular rearrangements that
cause conductance changes are complicated functions of
membrane potential. The relaxation time for conforma-
tional changes is in the millisecond range and depends on
the membrane potential. Thus, the conductances of the
Ca2" and K+ channels depend sensitively on the voltage
across the membrane as well as the relaxation time. A
detailed knowledge of how the proteins sense gating and
how this causes the channel to open or close is essential for
successful mathematical modeling.

Unfortunately, detailed information on the kinetics of
the V-gated Ca2+ channel and also the Cat-sensitive K+
channel is not available in the literature. Thus, we are led
to deduce a plausible kinetic mechanism for these two
channels, based on the observed electrical activity of the
fl-cell. The spikes that occur during the active phase
certainly demonstrate the importance of Ca2' and K+
permeability changes and moreover suggest that their

kinetics must follow a general shape given by the Hodgkin-
Huxley Na+ and K+ kinetics. We assume that the V-gated
calcium channel conductance, gca, takes a form similar to
the Hodgkin-Huxley Na+ channel conductance and the
Cai-sensitive K+ channel conductance, gK,ca, takes a form
similar to the Hodgkin-Huxley K+ channel conductance.
That is, gca and gK,ca, which yield the spikes at the plateau
potential of about -37 mV, take, respectively, the follow-
ing expressions:

gK.Ca = gK,Ca n

(4)

gca = gca m",

(5)
ca and gCa are, respectively, the maximum con-
where -
ductances of the Ca1-sensitive potassium and voltage-gated
calcium channels, n is the probability of opening of the
Cat-sensitive K+-channel, and mc. is the probability of the
activation of the Ca2+ channel conductance in the steady
state. Here, the assumption of rapid equilibrium for the m
kinetics is due to the fact that the time required for the
15ims) observed by Satin and
complete activation (i.e.,
Cook (1985) in cultured neonatal rat islet cells and by
Findlay and Dunne (1985) in RINm5F is much shorter
than the bursting periods (i.e., -10 s, which is of our
interest). We did not include the inactivation term "h" in
gc, because the experiment of Satin and Cook (1985) (and
also private communication with Dr. Ribalet) conclusively
shows that neither Ba2' nor Ca2, inactivates ICa com-
pletely within 40 ms. The voltage dependence of m<,, in our
model is that of Hodgkin and Huxley (1952) but V in
Hodgkin Huxley is replaced by - V + Vm, where Vm is a
constant that yields spikes at a plateau potential of about
-37 mV (see Appendix A). Note that in the Hodgkin-
Huxley model the exponents in Eqs. 4 and 5 are 4 and 3,
respectively. Our choice of using the exponent 2 in Eq. 4 is
that the open probability curves of Cook et al. (1984) and
also Findlay et al. (1985b) suggest that the slopes of the
open probability curves (at the half-maximal voltage) are
not so steep, such that the second power may fit these
curves better than the fourth. Our choice of the second
power in Eq. 5 is that it is the lowest power that gives rise to
the spike activity. We have done some computations (not
shown here) using higher exponents for both gCa and gK,
but the use of higher exponents forced us to use larger gK,Ca
and

values than those in Table I.

The open probability, n, in Eq. 4 is a dynamic variable,
with the relaxation time much larger than that of the m
kinetics, and according to the Hodgkin-Huxley kinetics it
should follow first-order kinetics

dn/dt = X[n_ - n]/rI,,

(6)

where n. is the steady state value of n, and r1,
is the
relaxation time having the unit of milliseconds, and X is a
unitless time scaling factor. The voltage dependence of n.
and -r
is that of Hodgkin and Huxley shifted by - Vn -Vc
mV on the voltage axis, i.e., V in the Hodgkin-Huxley

Vc= A In ([Ca2+]j/1IgM),

expression replaced by - V + Vn + Vc. The sensitivity of
gK.Ca on Ca, comes in through Vc, which depends on Cai
according to the relation (see Eq. 3 of Wong et al., 1982)
(7)
where A is a constant, which measures a sensitivity of the
open probability to Cai (Cook et al., 1984). The inactiva-
tion of gK,ca observed in the experiment of Findlay et al.
(1985b) was not considered here because the experimental
n., curves suggest that the inactivation term becomes
significant only in very high depolarization. The leak
conductance, gL, is taken to be constant.

In the (3-cell, the cytosolic Ca2" concentration is regu-
lated by influx of extracellular Ca2" ions entering the cell
from the extracellular space and efflux of Cai ions disap-
pearing from the transport systems located not only in
plasma membrane but also in membranes of mitochondria,
endoplasmic reticulum, and perhaps secretory granules.
Using the rate law, the time derivative of [Ca]i may be
expressed by

d[Ca2+ ]i/dt = f {3Ica/4ir3Fr -kF a [Ca2+ ]il,

(8)
where f is a ratio between the dissociation constant and
calcium binding buffer concentration (Chay, 1985b), and
kC, is the rate constant of effilux of intracellular Ca2+ ions.
A simple rate expression (i.e., kc, [Ca2]]i) was used for the
effilux term in place of a Michaelis-Menten equation or
Hill equation because the numerical solutions using either
of these equations yield essentially the same results as
reported here (Chay, 1985b). Moreover, since both the
Michaelis-Menten or Hill equation make use of additional
parameters (i.e., the Hill coefficient and the binding
constant), we find no advantage to using either of them.
Note that in our model glucose activates kca, the efflux
rate constant.

NUMERICAL RESULTS

As discussed in the previous section, our present model
contains the following dynamic variables: (a) the mem-
brane potential, V, whose variation with time is expressed
as the sum of ionic currents carried by K+ ions through a
Cai-sensitive K+ channel and by Ca2, ions through a
voltage-gated Ca2, channel, and by the electrogenic pumps
and carriers (see Eq. 1); (b) the probability of opening of
the Cat-sensitive K+ gate, n (see Eq. 6); and (c) the
intracellular Ca2, ionic concentration (see Eq. 8).

These differential equations were solved numerically on
a DEC-10 computer (Digital Equipment Corp., Malboro,
MA). A Gear algorithm (Hindmarsh, 1974) was used to
solve the three equations, where we set both the absolute
and relative error tolerances at 10'. This numerical
ordinary differential equation solver is very well suited to
solve stiff equations like ours. Most of the parameters (e.g.,
the radius r, the capacitance Cm, the extracellular and
intracellular potassium concentrations, the extracellular

calcium concentration, and the maximum conductances)
in the model are not adjustable parameters, and hence we
have obtained their values from experimental data on the
(-cells. Those that were not available in fl-cell experiments
were estimated from experiments on other cells. The
parameteric values used in our computation are listed in
Table I. Whenever the values other than those in Table I
are used, we listed them in the figure captions.

Fig. 1 illustrates the numerical solutions of the dynamics
of d-cell electrical activity obtained with an increasing
order of kc. from the top trace to the bottom. Bursts in the
membrane potential (solid line) and oscillations in the
intracellular calcium ionic concentration (dash line) result
from a limit cycle oscillation. As can be seen in the figure,
the burst mode in each panel has the following characteris-
tics: When the glucose concentration is raised (i.e., an
increase in kc.) beyond a certain value (i.e., kca > 0.007),
the membrane potential exhibits a typical pattern of a

burst, which includes a silent phase of repolarization
followed by a rapid depolarization and continuous spike
activity. The period of intracellular Ca2" oscillations is
identical to the burst period of membrane potential,
although their shapes are quite different. At the beginning
of a burst the Ca2" concentration rises rapidly, peaking
near the termination of the burst. This increase is caused
by the action potential spikes, and during spiking Ca2" ions
flow into the cell from the perfusion medium. When
[Ca2"]i approaches the maximum level, the membrane
potential falls abruptly to the minimum level of -52 mV.
Note that the amplitude of [Ca] oscillation is -16 nM
([Ca2+] nin= 0.886 and [Ca2,] max = 0.902). This is much
smaller than that obtained using our previous model, which
contains two separate K+ channels, i.e., a voltage-gated,

Ca,-insensitive K+ channel and a Cal-sensitive, voltage-
independent K+ channel (Chay and Keizer, 1983, 1985;
Chay, 1985b). The amplitude of [Ca]i oscillation, however,
could be made much bigger as A in Eq. 7 becomes smaller
(see the top panel of Fig. 5).

In the burst regime, we observe that the shape of
membrane potential depends very little on kca: i.e., the
maximum repolarization potential V, is -51.9 mV; the
plateau potential Vp is around -39 mV (at the beginning
of the burst Vp= -38.8 and V.,,= -19.8 at the end of
the burst Vp = -39.8 and V.,, = -25.8); the amplitude of
spike potential is -16 mV. The period of spikes at the
beginning of the burst is -100 ms, while it increases to
-400 ms at the termination of the burst. The above
observations are consistent with the experimental results of

Meissner and Preissler (1979). It is worthwhile to point out
here that the lack of dependence upon kc, of the Ca-range
and of the V-envelope (i.e., spike heights, plateau potential,
and silent phase - max V and min V), during bursting
could be seen nicely from Rinzel's mathematical analysis
(Rinzel, 1985). This independence is true for changes in
any parameters that appear only in the slow-variable
equation, c.f. Eq. 8.

Although the shape of V bursts looks the same for all the
kc. values, the duration of the silent phase becomes shorter
and the active period becomes longer as kca increases.
Increasing kca also results in a decrease in the burst
periodicity. But as kca is increased further the burst period
increases again. Above a certain kCa value (i.e., kca > 0.045
ms-'), the bursts disappear entirely and only spikes
remain. The kca response on the active duration and the

is consistent with the
burst periodicity shown in Fig. 1
glucose dose response on the ,B-cell electrical activity
observed experimentally (Beigelman et al., 1977; Ribalet
and Beigleman, 1979). As shown in the bottom trace, the
bursts near the onset of continuous spiking occur in a
chaotic manner. This aperiodicity is known as determinitic
chaos and is inherent in nonlinear dynamic systems like
ours (Chay and Rinzel, 1985; Chay 1985a). Aperiodicity
similar to this has been observed in experiments on the
fl-cells in high intermediate glucose concentration (Beigle-
man et al., 1977; Henquin et al., 1982).

In the top panel of Fig. 2 A, we show the two steady state
conductances gCa and gC., and in the bottom panel we
show the steady state currents, -ICa and 'KCa. Long dashes
are obtained using [Ca2"Ii = 1.0 gM, and short dashes
using [Ca], = 0.6,uM. Note that [Ca2"], activates IKCa but

770

inhibits Ic. Note also that the two ICa curves fall between
the two IK.C* curves. This explains how the burst may arise
from a system like ours. In the silent regime of the
membrane potential, the V-gated calcium channel is quite
inactive because of the low potential, and thus efflux of
[Ca]l is larger than the influx (see Eq. 8). Indeed, in the
earlier part of the silent regime, -IK,Ca is much larger than
Ica, since gK,c depends not only on V but also on [Ca2"] .
As the cytosolic calcium ionic concentration decreases, the
sum of the two currents, IK,Ca + ICa, becomes smaller,
finally reversing its sign near the termination of the silent
phase, i.e., -IK,Ca > Ia, This reversal of the sign, in turn,
activates V-gated calcium channels. In the active phase,
IK,Ca + Ic, maintains the positive sign, i.e., ICa is larger than
-IK,Ca' As the Ca2` channels open, calcium ions start to
enter from the extracellular space; this gives rise to
[Ca2`]j. An increase in [Ca2+]i activates Ca1-sensitive K+
channels. When enough Ca2` ions enter the cell, the sum,

IK,Ca + Ica,, becomes essentially zero, and the active phase
terminates when the sign is reversed. The cycle repeats
again.

Fig. 2 A was obtained using A = -50 mV and V. = -35
mV. IK,. depends not only on Cai but also on A and V,. To
show how the steady state IK,ca depends on these parame-
teric values, we have shown, in Fig. 2 B, the steady state
K+ current-voltage relation, for various values of A and V,.
As shown in this figure, increasing -A shifts the I-Vcurve
to the right (top) and increasing - V, shifts the curve to the
left (bottom).

The parameter A in Eq. 7, which measures a sensitivity
of Ca, on n.,, is highly variable for different types of insulin
secreting cells (Cook et al., 1984; Findlay et al., 1985) and
even within the same cell type (Cook et al., 1984), ranging
all the way from - 17 to -57 mV. We have examined the
effect of A on the bursting pattern by varying the value of
A, and the result is presented in Fig. 3. Note that an

increase of -A results in an increase of [Ca2+]i. Note,
however, that this increase gives rise to a decrease in the
amplitude Ca, oscillations. Note also that the increase in
[Ca2+]i is such that Vc = -A ln[Ca2"]m.n would remain
always at -6 mV (i.e., the sum Vn + Vc is maintained at
about -29 mV, if all other parameters are fixed at the
values given in Table I). Due to this requirement, [Ca]i
could never become greater than 1 ,uM, and as -A
becomes very large [Ca]i approach 1 AM. To have a value
greater than 1 ,uM, then, V1, should be larger than -29
mV. For V. larger than -29 mV, an increase in the
magnitude of A results in a decreases [Ca2+]i, i.e., as -A
becomes larger [Ca2+]i approaches 1 ,M with a smaller
amplitude of the oscillation. As shown in this example, V.
is a parameter that is responsible for raising a level of the
intracellular Ca2+ concentration. On the other hand, A is a
parameter which controls the amplitude of [Ca]; oscilla-
tions.

Cook et al. (1984) have shown that Ca2"-activated K+
channels in neonatal fl-cells are sensitive to pH; with the
slopes of E50 (i.e., the half maximal V) v. pH; curves
ranging from -31 to -100 mV per pH unit. To study the
effect of pH; on the burst pattern, we assume that H+ to be
a competitive inhibitor to Ca;, which affects the calcium
binding constant. In our model, the calcium binding con-
stant is modeled in Vn. The effect of varying Vn on bursting
behavior is shown in Fig. 4. Note that an increase of Vn
results in an increase in not only [Ca]i but also its
amplitude. Note also that the increase induces an increase
in the duration of the active phase similar to that evoked by
higher concentrations of glucose. This is consistent with the
observation made by Pace et al. (1983) and Eddlestone and
Beigelman (1983) on islet fl-cells in response to pH;, which
was made possible using the specific blockers of the Na/H
exchange system.

FIGURE 5 A large amplitude [CaJi oscillation achieved by decreasing the magnitude of A and V. (the top panel), a small amplitude achieved
by increasing the magnitude of both A and V. (the bottom panel). The parameters used for the top panel are A = -1 mV, V. = - 30 mV,f =

controls the amplitude and magnitude of [Ca2"]i oscilla-
tion. That is, an increase of the amplitude can be achieved
by decreasing -A and/or - Vn. Likewise, an increase of
[Ca2+]i can be achieved by increasing -A and/or by
decreasing -Vn. This effect is demonstrated in Fig. 5.
Decreasing -A and - Vn to 1 mV and 30 mV, respectively,
gives rise to a very large amplitude (i.e., 340 nM) and a
relatively high [Ca2"]j, and increasing -A and - Vn to 30
mV and 70 mV, respectively, gives rise to a very small
amplitude (i.e., 8 nM) and low [Ca2"];. Implications of this
result are that a cell whose gK,c, is insensitive to Cai would
yield a very large amplitude of [Ca]i oscillation during the
electrical bursting (see the top panel) and that the elec-
trical burst does not necessarily couple with a rise in the
intracellular calcium concentration (the bottom panel).

DISCUSSION

With mathematical modeling, we exploit the crucial role
that the Ca1-activated K+ channel plays on the electrical
activity of insulin-secreting pancreatic A-cells. Our model
reveals that the burst is, in fact, a consequence of the
existence of Ca2"-activated K+ permeability, which, with
voltage-gated Ca2" permeability, triggers the spike activity
and also terminates the active phase when a sufficient
amount of cytosolic Ca2" ions is raised. IK,Ca would domi-
nate the silent phase of the burst. On the other hand, ICa
would dominate the active phase, such that the influx of

Ca2" ions is larger than the efflux during the active phase,
and the reverse is true during the silent phase. This is why
the cytosolic Ca2' concentration oscillates in synchrony
with the membrane potential.

It appears that the role of the ATP-inhibited K+-
channel is to hold the membrane potential at the resting
potential of about - 70 mV, and thus an inhibition ofgKATp
(conductance of ATP-inhibited K+-channel) gives rise to
an activation of the voltage-gated Ca2' channel and Cat-
sensitive K+ channel activities. At the resting state, the
cytosolic calcium concentration is very low, because the
Ca2' channel gate is completed closed. The primary role of
glucose on the electrical activity is, then, to inhibit the
ATP-inhibited K+-channel activity, so as to activate both
voltage-gated Ca2" channels and Cai-sensitive K+ chan-
nels. The secondary role of glucose is to activate efflux of
Ca;, as our simulation result in Fig. 1 suggests. The fact
that a decrease in - V. gives rise to a long active phase and
an increase in [Ca2 ]i (see Fig. 4) raises an interesting
possibility that the initial rich active phase observed in the
transient biphasic phase may owe its origin to cytoplasmic
acidification as a result of mitochondrial sequestration.
The nadir observed in insulin release (Charles et al., 1975)
may then be a result of a rise in [Ca2+]j, due to a decrease
in pHi.

Lebrun et al. (1985) have observed that methylamine
inhibits glucose-induced insulin release without affecting

electrical activity, which was simultaneously measured in
single perifused islet from normal mice. Based on this
result, they have concluded that the glucose-induced elec-
trical activity represents an early event in the process of
stimulus-secretion coupling of insulin release. In view of
the fact that an increase of - VI/ induces a decrease of
[Ca2"]i without affecting the electrical activity (see the
bottom panel of Fig. 5), it is tempting to speculate that the
role of methylamine is to increase - VK, either by directly
affecting V,, or by raising pHi. Under such a low level of
[Ca]i, the f-cell can not release insulin.

With simultaneous recordings of membrane potential
and absorbance changes from an arsenazo III-injected
Aplysia neuron, Gorman and Thomas (1978) have shown
that [Ca2+]i rose during each spontaneous burst of action
potentials, and it fell in the silent phase. The amplitude of
the [Ca2+]i was estimated to be -50 nM. This value is
about the same as our simulated result shown in the bottom
trace of Fig. 3, which was obtained using A = -10 mV
(i.e., a cell which is not very sensitive to Ca1). If one can
find a way to decrease -A (i.e., to lessen the sensitivity of
to Ca1) without affect V1, it is quite feasible to
gK,c
monitor the [Ca2"]1
oscillation in the d-cell using the
fluorescent dyes such as quin2.

The value of 250 pS was estimated from measurements
of the single Ca1-sensitive K+ channel conductance of the
islet cells (Cook et al., 1984; Findlay et al., 1985). No
estimation was made for the number of these channels per
cell, however. Measurements in pancreatic acinar tissue
suggest that there may be as many as 45 channels per cell
(Maruyama et al., 1983). Using these values, we estimate
the maximum conductance to be -11.3 nS. This way of
estimating the maximum conductance value, however,
gives -50% larger than the actual K,Ca. Taking this into
consideration, we find gK,Ca to be 5.7 nS, which is about
four times larger than the value we have used in our
computation (see Table I). To demonstrate that we may
have easily doubled the value without affecting our results,
we have presented, in Fig. 6, the electrical burst, which was
obtained using kKc. = 3nS. The major difference between
this figure and that shown in the top panel of Fig. 2 is that

the spike frequency shown in Fig. 6 is about twice larger
than that of Fig. 2. It should be pointed out that a higher
exponent (than two) for the variable n (see Eq. 4) would
also give a bigger maximal conductance value.

While Hodgkin-Huxley kinetic constants have not been
determined for the fl-cell Ca2+ channel, peak I-V curves
have been determined by Satin and Cook (1985) in
neonatal fl-cells and Findlay and Dunne (1985) in
RINm5F. The former investigators have found that inacti-
vation is only partial and, therefore, not reproduced by
Hodgkin-Huxley kinetics and that the reversal potential
for Ca2+ appears to be in the neighborhood of +40 mV
indicating that the open channel I-V is very nonlinear and
probably dominated by constant field rectification. We
have included partial inactivation in Eq. 5 (i.e., by adding
the term h to the 0.3 power), and the result is presented in
Fig. 7. Note from this figure that although the inclusion of
inactivation gives a larger gC value, there is no indication
that the inactivation term is a crucial factor for the cell to
burst. We believe, however, that the rectification observed
by Satin and Cook may become important for varying
extracellular calcium concentration (which is not of our
interest in the present study). In regard to the value of gCa,
= 250 pS in our computation (see Table
we have used -
I). The upper bound of the single calcium conductance was
estimated to be 5 pS from the voltage noise measurements
across the pancreatic fl-cell membrane (Atwater et al.,
1981). Assuming that an estimation of the maximum
channel conductance from a single channel conductance
yields a value larger by a factor of 30%, we find that there
are at least 170 calcium channels per f-cell. Inclusion of a
mild inactivation term (see the caption of Fig. 7) gives a
much larger number of the channels (using the maximum
conductance value of 900 pS we estimate the minimum
number of calcium channels to be about 600 per cell).

We believe that the kinetics of gca and gK,Ca given in Eqs.
4 and 5 are not unique (for the cell to burst). We believe,
however, that the true channel activity (in the steady state)
has a shape similar to Ic, and IK,ca shown in Fig. 2. That is,
both 9Ca and gK,c have a sigmoidal shape; in physiological
[Ca2+]i they are steeply rising functions of membrane

potential near -35 mV; gK,C should be activated by
[Ca2" ]j; on the other hand, ICa should be inhibited either by
the "h" kinetics or by [Ca2+]. Perhaps, it
is worth
mentioning here that IK,C, in Fig. 2 has about the same
magnitude and shape as two potassium currents (Cat-
sensitive, V-insensitive K+ channel and V-gated, Cat-
insensitive K+ channel currents) combined in our earlier
model (Chay and Keizer, 1983, 1985; Chay, 1985a, b).

There is no direct experimental evidence to verify the
existence of the two separate K+ channels. Instead, the
single channel recording of Cook et al. (1984) and Findlay
et al. (1985) suggests that these two channels are indeed
identical.
Accurate determination of the channel properties is vital
to our understanding of the role of [Ca2"]i on the insulin
release mechanism. Continuing refinements of resolution

of patch-clamp recording will someday reveal detailed
information on the kinetics of the ionic channels in the
(3-cell. We will, then, be able to complete our mathematical
modeling. Nevertheless, a usefulness of our model, even
though it is still in its early stage, stems from its simplicity
and its accuracy to predict glucose-induced changes in
cytosolic free Ca2" concentration, which are not yet possi-
ble to measure in intact islets. In addition, our model would
help to sort out the relative functional importance of the
Cat-sensitive K+ channel and the voltage-gated Ca2" chan-
nel on the burst electrical activity.
