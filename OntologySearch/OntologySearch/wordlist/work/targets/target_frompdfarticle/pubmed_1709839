A Model of the Ventricular Cardiac

Action Potential

Depolarization, Repolarization, and Their Interaction

Ching-hsing Luo and Yoram Rudy

A mathematical model of the membrane action potential of the mammalian ventricular cell is
introduced. The model is based, whenever possible, on recent single-cell and single-channel data
and incorporates the possibility of changing extracellular potassium concentration [K].. The fast
sodium current, 'Nap is characterized by fast upstroke velocity (Vma.=400 V/sec) and slow recovery
from inactivation. The time-independent potassium current, IKI, includes a negative-slope phase
and displays significant crossover phenomenon as [K], is varied. The time-dependent potassium
current, IK, shows only a minimal degree of crossover. A novel potassium current that activates
at plateau potentials is included in the model. The simulated action potential duplicates the
experimentally observed effects of changes in [K], on action potential duration and rest potential.
Physiological simulations focus on the interaction between depolarization and repolarization
(i.e., premature stimulation). Results demonstrate the importance of the slow recovery of INa in
determining the response of the cell. Simulated responses to periodic stimulation include
monotonic Wenckebach patterns and alternans at normal [K]0, whereas at low [K]0 nonmono-
tonic Wenckebach periodicities, aperiodic patterns, and enhanced supernormal excitability that
results in unstable responses ("chaotic activity") are observed. The results are consistent with
recent experimental observations, and the model simulations relate these phenomena to the
underlying ionic channel kinetics. (Circulation Research 1991;68:1501-1526)

In the late 1970s, two models of the electrical
activity of cardiac cells were formulated based
on the formalism introduced by Hodgkin and
Huxley.1 McAllister et a12 developed a model of the
cardiac Purkinje fiber action potential. Subsequently,
Beeler and Reuter3 published a model of the electri-
cal activity of the mammalian ventricular myocyte
(referred to as the B-R model in the present paper).
The B-R model was based on experimental data that
were available at the time from voltage-clamp stud-
ies. These data were subject to limitations in avail-
able voltage-clamp techniques and their application
to multicellular preparations of cardiac muscle.4 In
addition, the concentrations of ions in the extracel-
lular clefts of the multicellular preparations were
unknown.

With the development of single-cell and single-
channel recording techniques in the 1980s, the limi-

tations of voltage-clamp measurements were over-
come and the intracellular and extracellular ionic
environments could be controlled. The data from
single-channel recordings provide the basis for a
quantitative description of channel kinetics and
membrane ionic currents. In 1985, DiFrancesco and
Noble5 developed a model of the Purkinje fiber
action potential based on available single-cell and
single-channel data. Our goal is to incorporate,
whenever possible, recent experimental information
that have accumulated since the formulation of the
B-R model into the formulation of a modified model
(referred to as the L-R model in the text) of the
mammalian ventricular action potential. The work
presented here constitutes the first phase of this
effort. In this paper we formulate the fast inward
sodium current and the outward potassium currents.
We use the model to investigate phenomena that are
dominated by these currents and are only minimally
influenced by the slow inward current. Therefore, we
retain the B-R formulation of the slow inward cur-
rent to support the plateau of the action potential.
This paper focuses on the depolarization and repo-
larization phases of the action potential and on phe-
nomena that involve interaction between these pro-
cesses. These include supernormal excitability,

Wenckebach periodicity, and aperiodic response of the
cell to periodic stimulation. These phenomena were
observed recently in single ventricular cells and in
Purkinje fibers.67 In the B-R model, the extracellular
concentrations of ions are fixed. Because changes in
extracellular potassium concentration exert a strong
effect on the time course of repolarization,8 9 we intro-
duce in the model the dependence of the potassium
currents on potassium concentration. We also incorpo-
rate a negative-slope characteristic of the time-inde-
pendent potassium current10'll and a novel potassium
channel that activates at plateau potentials.'2 The fast
sodium current is characterized by fast upstroke veloc-
ity (Vm)13 and slow recovery from inactivation,'4 a
property that strongly influences the response of the
cell to premature stimulation.

In addition to the study of mechanisms that
determine the behavior of the single cell, an accu-
rate model of the action potential is important to
simulation studies of propagation of excitation in
cardiac tissue. Our studies of propagation15x6 were
limited by the inability to simulate important situ-
ations of physiological and clinical significance such
as the effects of elevated extracellular potassium
concentration, an important aspect of ischemia. In
addition, our model simulations of reentry'7 dem-
onstrated the importance of the interaction be-
tween depolarization and repolarization in the in-
duction and maintenance of reentrant arrhythmias.
The need for an accurate representation of this
interaction to further elucidate mechanisms under-
lying abnormal propagation and arrhythmogenesis
provided yet another motivation for the develop-
ment of the action potential model presented here.

Methods

The general approach is based on a numerical
reconstruction of the ventricular action potential by
using Hodgkin-Huxley-type formalism.' The rate of
change of membrane potential (V) is given by

dV/dt= - (1/C) (Ii+Is,)

(1)
where C is the membrane capacitance, 'St is a stimu-
lus current, and Ii is the sum of six ionic currents: INa,
a fast sodium current; Is,, a slow inward current; IK, a
time-dependent potassium current; 1K1, a time-inde-
pendent potassium current; 1Kp, a plateau potassium
current; and lb, a time-independent background cur-
rent. The ionic currents are determined by ionic
gates, whose gating variables are obtained as a solu-
tion to a coupled system of eight nonlinear ordinary
differential equations. The ionic currents, in turn,
change V, which subsequently affects the ionic gates
and currents. The differential equations are of the
form

dy/dt= (yx -y)/ry

(2)

where

ry = l/(ay+ y)

and

y +=ac(a\+f3)

y represents any gating variable, r, is its time con-
stant, and y. is the steady-state value of y. a, and /3
are voltage-dependent rate constants. In addition,
aKI and I3K1 of the IK1 channel depend on extracellular
potassium concentration.

The integration algorithm used to solve the differ-
ential equations is based on the hybrid methods
introduced by Rush and Larsen'8 and Victorri et al. 9
Briefly, the algorithm uses an adaptive time step that
is always smaller than At
= msec. For time inter-
vals of relatively slow changes in V (AV.AVmin=0.2
mV), At is set equal to AVmaxV, where AVVmsx=0.8
mV. For time intervals of fast changes in V
(AV.lAVmax), At is set equal to AVmin/V. If this At
results in AV.AVmax, At is reduced until the condi-
tion AV<AVmax is met. During the stimulus, a fixed
time step (0.05 or 0.01 msec) is used to minimize
variability in the stimulus duration caused by the time
discretization procedure.2t)

Rate constants of ionic gates were obtained by
parameter estimation with an adaptive nonlinear least-
squares algorithm developed by Dennis et ali2" All
computer programs were coded in FORTRAN 77 (Mi-
crosoft, Seattle), and all simulations were implemented
(double precision) on a Macintosh IIcx computer.
Fornulation of Equations for Ionic Currents

All ionic currents are computed for 1 cm- of
membrane. Membrane capacity is set at 1 ALF/cm.22
The formulation is based on experimental data
adjusted to 37Â°C by using a Q1(, adjustment factor.
Ionic concentrations for standard preparations are
[K1.=5.4 mM, [K]i=145 mM,1' [Na]i=18 mM,1323
[Na]o=140 mM, and [Ca]0=1.8 mM. [Ca]i varies
during the action potential; we set [Ca]i=2x 104 mM
as an initial value under standard conditions. We
assume that a short-term stimulation does not appre-
ciably affect the ionic environment of the cell under
normal conditions and, therefore, the ionic concen-
trations (except [Ca]i) do not change dynamically in
our simulations. The complete set of equations for all
ionic currents is provided in Table 1.

INa,: Fast sodium current. The model of the fast
sodium channel incorporates both a slow process of
recovery from inactivation and adequate maximum
conductance that results in a realistic rate of mem-
brane depolarization. We adopt the activation (m)
and inactivation (h) parameters of Ebihara and
Johnson4 (we refer to the Ebihara-Johnson model of
INa as the E-J model). The formulation of these
parameters is based on data from cardiac cells (chick-
en embryo) and results in a realistic rate of depolar-
ization (Vmax=300 V/sec). However, it does not in-
clude the property of slow recovery. Following the
methods of Beeler and Reuter,3 we incorporate a
slow inactivation gate (j) to represent this slow
process. As suggested by Haas et al,24 the steady-

computed EK is -77 mV, a result that is consistent
with the measurements of Beeler and Reuter.3 Also,
note that GK=0.282 mS/cm2 for [K]0=5.4 mM. This
value is obtained from the fully activated current
IK=IK/X (B-R model,3 Figure 1) for V= -100 mV, a
potential at which Xi= 1.

Xi introduces the inward rectification property of
IK. It is obtained from the B-R expression for IK by
factoring out GK- (V-EK) at [K]O=5.4 mM. The
formulation is provided in Table 1. To verify that this
formulation correctly introduces the [K]0 depen-
dence of IK we plotted the computed fully activated
current (!K) for [K]O=5.4, 50, and 150 mM (Figure 1).
The behavior is consistent with the experimental
observations of McDonald and Trautwein,29 Matsu-

root dependence of single-channel conductance on
[K]O;
2) high selectivity for potassium (i.e., EKI
-Nernst potential of potassium). Kurachi30 identi-
fied an inactivation gate (K1) of the IKI channel. This
gate, in addition to its dependence on membrane
potential, depends on EKI and therefore on [K]0 KI
closes at high potentials and therefore IK1 has no
contribution at this range. In addition, the time
constant of KI is small (TKI=0.7 msec at V=-50 mV
for [K]0=5.4 mM), so it can be approximated by KI,
(its steady-state value).

Based on these findings, we formulate the IKI

current as follows:

To verify that this formulation correctly introduces
the [K]O dependence of IKI we plotted the computed
current-voltage curve for [K]0= 10, 20, 40, 75, and 150
mM (Figure 2). The results resemble the single-
channel measurements of Kurachi (see Figure 12B of
Reference 30). Note the strong inward rectification,
the crossover between curves of different [K]o, the
zero contribution at high potentials, and the negative
slope over a certain potential range. These charac-
teristics reflect the voltage and [K]o dependence of
the KI gate.

It should be emphasized that our definition of 1K1
differs from lKl of the B-R model. The B-R IK1 includes
contributions from other currents at plateau potentials.
Recently, it was recognized that the current at plateau
potentials results from a time-independent, [K]O-insen-
sitive channel (IKp)12 and a background current
(Ib).32-34 We formulate IKP to simulate the behavior of
the IKp current measured by Yue and Marban12:

IKp=GKp *Kp (V-EKp)

(6)
where Gyp=0.0183,
EKp=EKM, and Kp=l/{l+exp
[(7.488-V)/5.98]}. In addition, Ib is a background cur-
rent32-34 that can be formulated as

Ib=Gb (V-Eb)

(7)
where Gb=0.03921 and Eb= -59.87 mV. We define the
total time-independent potassium current, IK1(T), as

1K1(T) =IK1 +IKp +Ib

(8)
The parameters (conductances, gates, and reversal
potentials) of 1K1, 1Kp, and lb are obtained by using a
parameter estimation technique2' to fit the whole-cell
IK1(T) measured by Sakmann and Trube (Figure 4A of
Reference 11) for different values of [K],. A compari-
son of the measured and simulated lK1(T) is shown in
Figure 3 for different values of [K],. Note that the
negative slope (which is not a property of the B-R IKI)
and crossover phenomena are well duplicated by the
model. Also, all curves for different values of [K],
converge at plateau potentials. This is because 1K1,
which depends on [K]0, has zero contribution at this
potential range, while IKp and lb are [K]0 insensitive.

Results

Ionic Currents and the Action Potential

The goal of this paper is to investigate, at the ionic
channel level, the mechanisms of various electrophysi-
ological phenomena related to depolarization, repolar-
ization, and their interaction. We limit the simulations
to phenomena that are dominated by the fast inward
sodium current and the outward potassium currents.
Figure 4A shows simulated action potentials for dif-
ferent extracellular concentrations of potassium
([K]0=3, 4, 5.4, and 7 mM). For the typical physiolog-
ical concentration of potassium ([K]o,noral=5.4 mM),
the following characteristics are observed: the thresh-
old potential is at -60 mV, the membrane rate of
depolarization (Vm.x) is 400 V/sec, the maximum pla-
teau potential is 17.7 mV, action potential duration
(APD) at 90% repolarization is 366 msec, resting
potential is -84 mV, and the overshoot potential is 41.7
mV. Note that Vm; is more than three times that of the
B-R model (VmaXBR=115 V/sec). The fast Vma,,LR re-
flects the higher sodium channel conductance in our
model and is in good agreement with experimental data
from mammalian ventricular cells.'3 Also, Vm&xLR is
faster than that of the E-J model (Vm,EJ=300 V/sec).
This difference results from different reversal poten-
tials for the sodium current (ENa,L R=54.4 mV, whereas

in the L-R model. The difference in the reversal
potential reflects different intracellular concentrations
of sodium in the mammalian ventricular cell ([Na]i= 18
mM) and the chicken embryo ([Na]i=40 mM). The
overshoot is in good agreement with experimental
measurements in guinea pig ventricular cells.3' 35

The major simulated effects of changes in extracel-
lular potassium concentration are on APD and rest
potential (Vrest), whereas effects on plateau poten-
tials are minimal. These results are in agreement with
experimental observations.8'9 As [K]O increases, Vrest
becomes less negative and APD decreases. For
[K]0=3 mM, Vrest is -95.5 mV and APD is 485 msec;
for [K]0=7 mM, Vrest is -78.2 mV and APD is 322.6
msec. For the typical value [K]0=5.4 mM, APD is 366
msec. This value is in the range of 305 msec with a
standard deviation of 55 msec measured by Isenberg
and Klockner3' in the guinea pig single ventricular

ISi during the action potential. Note the peak in IK1(T)
during repolarization (arrows). For [K]0=7 mM the
amplitude of this peak is 2.87 ALA/cm2, but for [K]o= 3
ALA/cm2. This large difference in
mM it is only 1.0
IK1(T) brings about a faster rate of repolarization (1.58
V/sec at 7 mM, 1.1 V/sec at 3 mM) at higher [K]. In
addition, the peak of IK1(T) occurs earlier (at more
positive membrane potential), reflecting an increase
of the reversal potential EK1. The result is a shorter
APD. Note that IK and Isi exhibit only small changes
in amplitude during repolarization when [K]o is var-
ied (although these currents deactivate earlier in
response to the earlier decrease in membrane poten-
tial). This is because I1i
is independent of [K]0,
whereas the IK dependence on [K]O is minimal at
plateau potentials (inward rectification, Figure 1). In
contrast. IK1(T) shows strong dependence on [K]O at
plateau potentials caused by the crossover phenom-
enon of 'K1 (Figure 2). The changes in Vrest parallel
changes in the reversal potential of the IKI current
(EKI) caused by changes in [K]0. In the following

porates a fast process of inactivation and a much
slower process of recovery from inactivation. In this
section we demonstrate the importance of the fast
(realistic) rate of depolarization caused by the kinet-
ics of INa in determining membrane behavior. Recov-
ery of excitability can be described in terms of tu and
tth (defined below) by using the protocol of Figure 5.
Test pulses (S2) 1.77 ALA in amplitude and 100 msec
in duration are applied at various (SS2) intervals
from a brief suprathreshold stimulus (S,), which
excites a conditioning action potential. Because
S1S2>APDu, S2 is always applied during phase 4 of
the action potential. The time from the onset of S to
threshold is tth (V=V,h- -60 mV). The time from the
onset of S2 to the action potential upstroke as deter-
mined from Vmax is tu. As the S1S2 interval decreases,
tu and tth increase, providing a measure of the
excitability of the membrane; the longer tu and tth,
the less excitable the membrane.

Figure 6 shows the relation between tu and tth
obtained from the protocol of Figure 5. Panel A
duplicates the experimental results of Delmar et al
(Figure SB in their paper).28 Panel B shows the
simulated results of the same protocol using the B-R
membrane model but with the sodium channel re-
placed by the L-R formulation. Panels C and D
depict simulated results with the original E-J and
B-R sodium channel representations, respectively.

The results demonstrate that the experimental
behavior (panel A) is duplicated accurately by the
L-R and E-J models (panels B and C). However, B-R
kinetics of the sodium channel (panel D) causes

mar et al.28 Panel B: Present (L-R) model.
Panel C: Ebihara-Johnson (E-J) model. Panel
D: Beeler-Reuter (B-R) model. Note that the
experimental behavior is simulated correctly by
the L-R and E-J models that incorporate real-
istic kinetics of the fast sodium current (fast
maximum upstroke velocity), while the B-R
model simulation deviates from the experimen-
tal behavior, especially for large values of tu
and t,t

time to threshold and is equivalent to tF used by
Delmar et a128). The tu and tth scales are both
nonnalized to a minimum value of 1.0.

significant deviations from the actual experimental
behavior. These include a strong deviation from the
linear relation for larger tth (arrow) and a larger slope
(-2.5 times, note different tu scale in panel D) of the
linear portion for smaller tth. The slope is close to 1.0
for the L-R and E-J models, duplicating the experi-
mental behavior well and indicating that the increase
in tu is determined by the increase in tth (subthresh-
old response). This is because the latency from
is very small (about 2
threshold potential to Vma
msec) when the realistic conductance and kinetics of
the cardiac sodium channel are incorporated in the
model (GNa,BR=4 mS, GNa,LR=23 mS). In contrast,
the large slope of the B-R model indicates a signifi-
cant latency from threshold potential to Vmax (greater
than 25.5 msec), resulting from the unrealistic con-
ductance and kinetics of the sodium channel in that
model.

Time course of reactivation. The simulations in this
section demonstrate the importance of the slow
recovery property of INa in determining the mem-
brane reactivation. As mentioned in previous sec-
tions, the E-J model does not include the process of
slow recovery from inactivation represented by the j
gate. Panel A of Figure 7 duplicates the experimental
reactivation data of Ebihara et al (Figure 3 of Ref-
erence 36). Panel B shows the results of a simulation
with the L-R model. The protocol used both in the
experiment and in the model simulations is also
illustrated in panel B. Panels C and D are simulations
with the B-R and E-J models, respectively. The
protocol is as follows: two depolarizing voltage pulses
with 45-mV amplitude are applied after preclamping
the membrane at -65 mV for 300 msec. The first
pulse of duration T1 inactivates the sodium channel.
T2, the interval between the depolarizing pulses, is
varied to provide different reactivation times before
the second test pulse of a constant duration (65

msec) is applied. The membrane response to the
second pulse in terms of the peak inward current is
plotted as a function of T2.

The experimental behavior (panel A) is well dupli-
cated by the L-R model (panel B). The individual
curves in panel A are obtained for T1 in the range
1-200 msec, while in panel B the range is 1-50 msec.
This quantitative difference probably reflects the
different species (chicken embryo and guinea pig).
The B-R model (panel C) deviates from the experi-
mentally observed behavior, especially for T1 = 1
msec. As explained below, this is caused by the
unrealistic INa kinetics of the B-R model. The E-J
model (panel D) completely fails to duplicate the
dependence on T1, and the curves obtained for
different T1 values overlap.

The E-J model (panel D) fails to separate the
curves for different T1 values because slow recovery
(j gate) is not part of this model, so that inactivation
and reactivation of the sodium channel are con-
trolled by the fast inactivation h gate. Because in this
model h is almost completely inactivated in 1 msec
when the membrane potential is depolarized to -20
mV (Th=0.33 msec at -20 mV), all curves for T1.1
msec overlap. In contrast, the L-R model (panel B)
generates different reactivation curves for different
values of T1, as observed experimentally. This is
because the model incorporates a slow inactivation j
gate (rj=4.34 msec at -20 mV). This implies that for
T1=1 and 5 msec the j gate at the end of T1 is
inactivated to a different degree, resulting in dif-
ferent reactivation curves. For T1 .20 msec, the j gate
is completely inactivated at a membrane potential of
-20 mV, and all the curves overlap. In addition,
since for T1> 1 msec the recovery process is con-
trolled by the j gate, all reactivation curves can be fit
by a single exponential. In particular, for T1 .20 msec
all curves are represented by the same time constant

Membrane responsiveness. This simulation demon-
strates the importance of the slow inactivation j gate
in determining the membrane response during the
repolarization phase of an action potential. Results
are shown in Figure 8. Panel A is the experimental
data of Gettes and Reuter (Figure 7 of Reference
14). Panels B, C, and D are the L-R, B-R, and E-J
models, respectively. The protocols are illustrated in
panel A. Curve 1 is obtained from protocol 1 by
applying a suprathreshold stimulus that scans the
repolarization phase of an action potential. Curve 2 is
obtained from protocol 2 by stimulating the mem-
brane after 500 msec of preclamping at different
potential levels. For both curves Vmx is shown (dis-
crete points) as a function of the membrane potential
at the onset of the stimulus. In panels B-D the solid
curves are h . j (or only h for the E-J model) com-
puted for the same protocols.

By using protocol 1, the range of membrane po-
tential over which Vmax drops from its maximum value
to 0.2 of the maximum is well simulated by the L-R
and B-R models. This normalized value (0.2) is
obtained experimentally (panel A, curve 1) for a
membrane potential of -76 mV. The corresponding
simulated values are -78 mV for both models. In
contrast, curve 1 in the E-J model (panel D) is shifted
to less negative potentials. This is because the E-J
model does not incorporate a slow recovery process
of the sodium channel. An equivalent statement is
that in the E-J model j is always 1. However, the L-R
and B-R models incorporate a slow recovery j gate
that is not fully recovered during the repolarization
phase, shifting the curve to a more negative range of
membrane potentials.

Curve 2 reflects steady-state behavior of the mem-
brane since the stimulus was applied after a long
(500-msec) preconditioning period. The L-R model
correctly simulates the behavior of Vmax for these
conditions (compare curve 2 in panels B and A). In
contrast, a shift of curve 2 to more negative potentials
is observed in the B-R model (panel C). This differ-
ence reflects the different characteristics of h. and jc
in the two models.
Note that the Vmax behavior is closely approxi-
mated by the h - j curves (deviations are caused by
currents other than INa). This implies that the mem-
brane responsiveness is controlled by the h and j
gates (because of its fast time constant, m obtains its
maximum value of 1 within 0.2 msec and its effect is
negligible). Because curve 2 is obtained under
steady-state conditions, it is closely approximated by
h. * j,. The difference between curves 1 and 2 results
from the fact that during repolarization (curve 1) h
and j do not reach their steady-state values. The E-J
model does not incorporate a j gate. Therefore, the
difference between curves 1 and 2 in panel D implies
that the rate of repolarization is too fast for h to
reach steady state. Of course, the same is true for the
much slower j gate. Since during repolarization j is

almost completely inactivated and since rj> > rh, it
follows that the membrane responsiveness is mostly
determined by the j gate.
Supemormal Excitability

Supernormality, which can be defined as greater
than normal excitability during or immediately after
the action potential repolarization phase, is a known
property of cardiac preparations at low extracellular
potassium concentrations.737-39 The strength-inter-
val curve, used to investigate supernormality, is ob-
tained from the protocol shown in Figure 5 by
applying a test pulse, S2, after an action potential
excited by a stimulus, S,. By varying the S1S2 interval
and the current amplitude of S2, the threshold cur-
rent (Ith) is obtained as a function of the S1S2 interval.
Based on such excitability measurements, Spear and
Moore39 found that 1) supernormality disappears
when [K]o is elevated above 5 mM and 2) the
supernormal period at fixed [K]O is independent of
the APD and is determined by the characteristics of
the membrane potential during repolarization. 'K1
and IK of the L-R model can change their reversal
potentials and conductances in response to variations
in [K]O. We used the L-R model to simulate and
investigate supernormality. Figure 9 shows the simu-
lated strength-interval curves for [K]0=7, 4.6, 4, and
3 mM, covering late phase 3 and early phase 4 of the
action potential. The simulated protocol followed the
experimental protocol described above (also see Fig-
ure 5). lth is defined as the critical current amplitude
for which the peak sodium current is greater than 4
,uA (1% of the maximum current for a fully recov-
ered membrane and suprathreshold stimulus). Note
that test stimuli of very short duration (T=0.5 msec)
were used to investigate the instantaneous mem-
brane excitability at that S1S2 interval. The abscissa is
normalized by setting the 70% repolarization of the
action potential as time zero. Clearly, supernormality
is observed for [K]0.4.6 mM (but not for [K]0=7 or
5.4 mM) as a notch (local minimum followed by a
local maximum) in the strength-interval curve. With
decreasing [K]0, the peak-to-peak amplitude of the
notch increases and so does the width of the "super-
normal window." This time window is defined as the
interval during which the threshold is lower than the
local maximum that follows the notch. The supernor-
mal window is indicated in the figures by two broken
vertical lines.

Plotting Ilh versus the potential difference
(AV=Vth-V) for the membrane to reach the thresh-
old potential (Vth), the linear relation of Figure 10 is
obtained for all values of [K]0. This linear relation
implies that the membrane response during repolar-
ization can be characterized in terms of the mem-
brane potential and the threshold potential for all
values of [K]O. It also implies that the threshold
current does not depend on APD, as observed exper-
imentally by Spear and Moore.39

mality in terms of membrane channel kinetics, the

The j gate of the sodium channel was clamped at the
value of 1 for all times and the strength-interval
curve was computed (Figure llA). The unclamped
strength-interval curve is also plotted for compari-
son. With j = 1, sodium channel recovery from inacti-
vation is controlled by the h gate and its much faster
kinetics (h< <rj). Under these conditions, supernor-
mality is observed in Figure IIA even for [K]-=7
mM. In contrast, when j is free to vary according to its
normal kinetics, no supernormality is observed for
this concentration of K,,,

are plotted as a function of time during repolariza-
tion. The curve for V is the same for both j =1 and
j-unclamped conditions (because the sodium channel
does not contribute to V during repolarization). On
the other hand, the Vth curve is influenced by the j
gate kinetics. For the clamped condition (j=1) Vth
decreases earlier in time, reflecting faster recovery of
membrane excitability. Also, the value of Vth just
after the absolute refractory period (arrows) is
larger, followed by a steep decrease (approximately
3.5 V/sec) over a period of 6 msec. During the same
interval, the membrane potential drops at a rate of
about 1.33 V/sec. This implies that AV (defined as
Vth- V) is decreasing rapidly during this interval,
bringing about a proportional decrease in lth (Figure
10) that constitutes the descending portion of the
lA,
notch in the strength-interval curve (Figure
DES). Beyond this interval, the membrane potential
drops faster than Vth, increasing AV and, therefore,
lth (ascending portion of the notch, ASC in Figure
HA). This nonmonotonic behavior of AV is the basis
for the notch in the strength-interval curve and,
hence, for supernormality. For larger values of t, both
Vth and V approach their steady-state values with AV
(and hence Ith) approaching a constant. When the j
gate is free to vary according to its normal kinetics (j-
unclamped in Figure 1lB), the Vth curve is shifted to
the right toward later times. As a result, the drop in
the Vth curve occurs over an interval during which V
decreases slowly and, in particular, always slower
than Vth (0.5 and 1.4 V/sec, respectively). Conse-
quently, AV (and Ith)
is monotonically decreasing
(j-unclamped in Figure HA), and no supernormality
is observed. It is clear that the nonmonotonic, super-
normal behavior is determined by the shape of the
Vth curve, which in turn is determined by the recovery
of the sodium channel. As will be explained below,
the sodium channel recovers faster at low [K],

[K]o.4.6 mM.
A clear demonstration of the dominant effect of
the sodium recovery process on the Vth curve is
provided in Figure liB. When both the h gate and j
gate are clamped at the value of 1, Vth is constant,
except for a small decrease (for t<30 msec) caused
by L,i (this decrease in Vth disappears when we set
Is=O during the stimulation). The threshold poten-
tial is also affected by IK1(T) and IK; however, the
contribution is very small.

Figure 12 shows V and Vth as a function of time for
different [K], in the range of 3-7 mM (j is free to vary
according to its normal kinetics). As [K], decreases
from 7 to 3 mM, the resting membrane potential
changes from -78.2 to -95.5 mV (Figure 12A),
resulting in a decrease of ij from 33 to 7 msec during
late phase 3 and phase 4 of the action potential
(arrows in Figure 12A). Therefore, the sodium chan-

nel recovers earlier for lower [K]o (Figure 12B)
during a phase of fast decrease of V. As a result, a
phase is created during which V decreases faster than
Vth. In addition, the membrane potential reaches a
phase of very slow decrease (i.e., end of ascending
portion of the supernormal notch) later in time for
lower [K]0 (arrows in Figure 12A). The result of these
two effects is the appearance of a supernormal
window for [K]0.4.6 mM and a widening of this
window as [K]0 is further decreased (Figure 9). The
peak-to-peak amplitude of the supernormal notch
also increases when [K]0 is decreased. This is because
the local minimum (see Figure 9) decreases, re-
flecting a smaller AV caused by the faster decrease of
Vth for lower [K]O (Figure 12B). Also, the local

It should be emphasized that the E-J representa-
tion of the sodium channel does not include a slow
inactivation j gate. Therefore, the E-I strength-
interval curves are similar to the strength-interval
curves obtained by the L-R model with j=1. As
shown above (Figure 11A), under these conditions,
supernormality is a property of the model even for
high extracellular concentrations ([K]0-=7 mM) in
contradiction to experimental observations.7,39 This,
of course, is a nonphysiological behavior that results
from a nonphysiological fast recovery of the sodium
channel.

The simulations described above were performed
with a test stimulus, S2, of 0.5-msec duration. Exper-
imentally, Chialvo et a17 used a stimulus of 20 msec.
Our choice of a short stimulus was dictated by the
resolution needed for scanning the supernormal win-
dow whose minimum duration is 12 msec. Also, we
were interested in determining instantaneous mem-
brane excitability without the influence of a long
stimulus duration. To investigate the effects of the
stimulus duration (T) on membrane excitability, we
redefine the strength-interval curve in terms of
threshold charge introduced by the stimulus
(Qth=lth* T, Figure 13). In Figure 13A, Qth iS plotted
for an interval of 80 msec that includes the supernor-
mal phase. Stimuli of two durations (T=0.5 and 20
msec) are compared. For T=20 msec, Qth is larger
(note different scales), the amplitude of the super-
normal notch is twice as large, and the notch is
shifted toward earlier time. Figure 13B covers a later
time interval that includes late phase 4 of the action
potential. During this time interval, the behavior of
Qth for T=0.5 and 20 msec is very different. For
T=0.5 msec, Qth displays a very small and slow
increase, while for T=20 msec, Qth displays a rela-
tively large decrease. It should be commented that
similar results were obtained for all [K], values,
except no supernormality was observed for [K]0>4.6
mM ([K]0=4 mM is shown here as an example).

Figure 14 provides an explanation for these differ-
ences between strength-interval curves constructed
with stimuli of different durations. Figure 14A shows
the total charge (Qtotal) carried by all ionic channels
during critical subthreshold stimuli for a short
(T=0.5 msec) and a long (T=20 msec) stimulus
duration (note the different scales). For both dura-
tions, Qtotal is positive, indicating a net positive charge
leaving the cell. For T=0.5 msec, Qtotal is negligible
compared with the stimulus charge Qth (Figure 13).
However, for T=20 msec, Qtotal is about half the
magnitude of Qth (Figure 13, note the different
scales). This significant amount of charge that is lost
to the extracellular medium during a long stimulus is
the basis for the difference between the strength-
interval curves of Figure 13. The Qth supplied by a
very short stimulus can be regarded as the amount of
charge needed to bring the membrane to threshold
with minimal charge losses to the extracellular me-

dium. In contrast, the Qth supplied by a long stimulus
can be divided into two components: Qth supplied by
a very short stimulus and the total charge (Ototal) lost
to the extracellular medium during the duration of
the stimulus. The fact that Qth includes Qtotal explains
the large values of Qth, including the large amplitude
of the maximum that follows the supernormal notch
(Figure 13A) when a long stimulus duration is used.

ionic channels to Qtotal for a stimulus of 20 msec

IK1(T) as the reason for the large rheobase needed
when long stimuli are used (Figure 13B). During
phase 3 (t<20 msec), a large decrease in Ototal from

Figure 13, while for long duration (T=20 msec), Qtotal (right

the total time-independent potassium current charge (QK1(T))

decay of time-dependent potassium current charge (QK) re-

its peak value is observed as the 20-msec stimulus is
applied earlier in time (Figure 14A, arrow). This is
caused by an increase in the magnitude of (the
negative) Qi and a decrease of QK1(T) as t decreases
(Figure 14B). Qsi increases since, for a small t, the
stimulus is applied during a phase when ISi is not
completely inactivated. QK1(T) decreases because the
stimulus is applied during the negative slope phase of
1K1. This additional contribution of 2.3 nanocoulombs
to the decrease in Qth is a substantial fraction of the
amplitude of the supernormal notch (6 nC). The
result is a supernormal notch of about twice the
amplitude as compared with that for a 0.5-msec

stimulus (Figure 13A). The relatively fast decrease of
Qth during phase 4 (t=30-450 msec in Figure 13B,
T=20 msec), when long stimuli are used, reflects a
similar behavior of QK (Figure 14B). Note that
contributions from all other currents are constant dur-
ing this phase; in particular, QK1(T) is constant since
IK1(T) is time independent and the membrane potential
during this phase is almost constant. Therefore, for
long stimuli, the membrane excitability during phase 4
is determined by the kinetics of IK (the time-dependent
X gate). In contrast, Qth is almost constant over the
entire phase 4 when short stimuli are used (Figure 13B,
T=0.5 msec). This is because for short stimuli Qth iS
determined by VSh and V (negligible contribution from
Qtotal) which do not change significantly during phase 4.
As will become clear in the next section, the behavior of
the strength-interval curve during phase 4 strongly
influences the response of the cell to repetitive stimu-
lation. For short stimulus duration one expects minimal
dependence of the response on the timing of stimula-
tion during phase 4 (constant excitability, Figure 13B,
T=0.5 msec). In contrast, for long stimuli, the response
is strongly influenced by the timing (Figure 13B, T=20
msec). This implies that to investigate rate-dependent
response patterns (e.g., Wenckebach periodicity), stim-
uli of long duration should be used.
Wenckebach Periodicity and Channel Behavior

Wenckebach periodicity is defined as a periodic,
rate-dependent activation failure in cardiac tissue.
Recently, this phenomenon was observed in isolated
guinea pig6 or rabbit40 ventricular myocytes and in
sheep cardiac Purkinje fibers.7 In this section we
study the Wenckebach phenomenon by simulating
periodic pacing of single myocytes with the use of the
L-R membrane model. The response of the mem-
brane to periodic stimulation can be analyzed in
terms of the strength-interval curve and the APD

tion) and to be consistent with the experimental
protocols of Chialvo et a17 and Delmar et al.6 Stim-
ulation was applied at a basic cycle length (BCL)
ranging from 160 to 2,000 msec. Simulated activation
patterns for different BCLs are shown in Figure 16A.
A staircase plot of response-to-stimulus (R: S) ratios
versus BCL is shown in Figure 16B (numbers in the
figure indicate stimulus-to-response [S: R] ratios).
The staircase pattern demonstrates phase-locking at
S: R ratios of integer values (1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, etc.) and
sharp transitions between these values through many
noninteger S: R ratios. This pattern is in good agree-
ment with the experimental observations of Chialvo
et al.7 To elucidate the underlying mechanism of the
Wenckebach phenomenon observed in single cells
the following simulations were performed.

As we discussed in the previous section, the post-
refractory period (phase 4 of an action potential) is
dominated by the X gate of 1K.6728 Therefore, the
Wenckebach phenomenon is likely to be related to
the value of X just before the stimulation is applied
(Xs). To test this assumption, Xs of a given beat was
clamped to the value of Xs of the preceding beat.
Independent of the particular beat where clamping
was applied the following behavior was observed: 1)
S: R pattern always progressed to S+ 1: R+ 1 pattern
and 2) the superimposed action potentials of the two
beats with the same Xs overlapped because of equal
time latency from stimulus to response. An example
of this procedure is shown in Figure 17 for an initial

S:R=6:5 (see Figure 16A). The Xs of the fourth
beat was clamped to the Xs of the third beat. The
pattern (Figure 17A) has changed to S:R=7:6 be-
cause of resetting of the fourth beat to the third beat.
When the action potentials are superimposed (Fig-
ure 17B) by setting time zero at the onset of each
stimulus, the action potential of the clamped beat
overlaps with the previous action potential (i.e., tu
and APD [defined in Figure 5] have the same values
for the two beats). Also, when Xs for all beats is
clamped to Xs of the first beat (not shown) S: R is
always 1:1. Clearly, Xs plays a dominant role in
determining the pattern of Wenckebach periodicity.
To further elucidate the mechanism through which
the IK X gate controls the activation pattern, we
plotted APD, APDu, tu (see Figure 5 for definitions),
and Xs as a function of beat number (Figure 18). The
periodic 6:5 pattern discussed above was used as an

example. Beat 1 in the figure refers to the first beat
after activation failure during the previous period.
The APDU of the second beat (APDU2) is smaller
than the APDU of the first beat (APDu1). This is due
to a larger decrease (7.7 msec) in APD than the
increase (6 msec) of tu from the first beat to the
second beat (note APDu=APD+tu). The relatively
large decrease of APD from beat 1 to beat 2 reflects
the twice-longer recovery time before beat 1 that
results in a long APD1 (arrow b in Figure 15) as
compared with APD2 (arrow a in Figure 15). Also, a
corresponding large increase in Xs is observed. Start-
ing from beat 2, APDu and tu increase monotoni-
cally, whereas APD remains almost constant and Xs
increases very slowly. The monotonic increase in
APDu implies a progressively shorter recovery time
between beats starting from beat 2. As a result, X is
progressively less deactivated at the time of the
stimulation (Xs increases monotonically), until fail-
ure occurs. When we set Xs for all beats equal to Xs
of the first beat, activation failure does not occur and
the pattern is always 1:1. This mechanism is consis-
tent with the explanation of Delmar et al.28

A deviation from this behavior is observed for the
first two beats (Figure 18). APDu decreases from
beat 1 to beat 2, implying a longer recovery time
before beat 3 than before beat 2. However, in spite of
the longer recovery time before beat 3, XS3 is greater
than XS2. This seemingly anomalous behavior results
from the very different initial conditions at the onset
of beats 1 and 2. Beat 1 occurs at an interval of
2* BCL from the last successful beat of the previous
period, implying a much longer (about twice) recov-
ery time than that for all other beats. As a result, X
is almost completely deactivated at the onset of beat
1 (XS1=0.007), reaching a maximum value of 0.4215
at plateau potentials. At the onset of beat 2, because
of much shorter recovery time, X is much less
deactivated (XS2=0.0527), reaching a maximum value
of 0.4262 during this beat. The larger maximum value
of X at plateau potentials more than compensates for
the increase in recovery time, resulting in XS3 >XS2
(XS3=0.0529). Hence, in spite of an initial decrease in
APDU, Xs increases monotonically from beat to beat
until failure occurs. It should be mentioned that the
"anomalous" decrease in APDu from beat 1 to beat
2 is not always observed. When stimulating, for the
same S: R pattern, at longer BCLs (and therefore
with lower stimulus strength) we observe a mono-
tonic increase in APDu for all beats, similar to the
observations of Delmar et al.28 This is because as
BCL becomes progressively longer (relative to rx),
the change in Xs from beat 1 to beat 2 becomes
progressively smaller, resulting in a smaller decrease
of ADP until APD approaches a constant value. In
contrast, for a given S :R pattern, the increase of tu
from beat 1 to beat 2 remains in the range of 5.5-7
msec for all BCLs (obviously, to keep the same S: R
pattern the stimulus strength was adjusted for dif-
ferent BCLs). Because APDu=APD+tu, APDU in-

creases from beat 1 to beat 2 for long BCLs, resulting
in a monotonic behavior throughout the period.

The staircase of Figure 16B is shifted toward
shorter BCLs when the stimulus strength is in-
creased. In particular, the transition from the 1: 1
pattern to the 2:1 pattern is obtained at BCL=448
msec (rather than 882 msec) when the stimulus
strength is increased to 3.34 ,uA. The transition from
1: 1 to 2: 1 at shorter BCLs is preceded by alternans
in APDU as BCL is decreased in the range of 1:1
response, approaching the transition to 2:1. APDu
for consecutive beats together with the initial values
of the IK X gate and the I,i f gate are shown in Figure
19. Clearly, the alternans in APDu result from alter-
nating kinetics of both the IK and 'Si channels. When
f and X at the time of stimulus for all beats are set
equal to their values at the first beat, no alternans are
observed. When only the f gate is clamped as above,
the transition from the 1: 1 pattern to the 2: 1 pattern
still occurs; however, the number of alternating beats
is decreased (four instead of seven), and the ampli-
tude of the APDU changes is reduced. In contrast,
when only the X gate is clamped, the 1:1 pattern is
maintained and no transition from the 1:1 to 2:1
pattern is observed, indicative of the dominant role
Of IK in determining the response to repetitive stim-
ulation at all values of BCL. Alternans in APDU are
still observed; however, their number is reduced to
four beats, and the amplitude of the APDU changes is
greatly diminished.

The simulations described above identify the ionic
channel kinetics responsible for the alternans phe-
nomenon. It remains to be clarified why these alter-
nans appear only for short BCLs (BCL<560 msec in
our simulations). Under these conditions (the exam-
ple we show is for BCL=448 msec) we observe a
relatively large decrease (56.2 msec) in APDU from
beat 1 to beat 2 that reflects a large decrease (61.8
msec) in APD. The large change in APD is possible
because short BCL corresponds to the steep portion
of the APD restitution curve (Figure 15). Mechanis-
tically, the large APD change results from a relatively
large increase in X gate and a decrease in f gate
(Figure 19). This decrease in APDU is followed by a
long recovery time of 130.4 msec to the third beat.
This recovery time is long enough so that the X gate
at the onset of beat 3 is relatively more deactivated in
spite of its large initial value at the onset of beat 2,
bringing about an increase in APDu of beat 3. The
following recovery time is therefore decreased, re-
sulting in a decrease in APDU of beat 4. This
alternating pattern continues until a stable steady
state is achieved with a constant APDu=327.66 msec.
In contrast, for BCL>700 msec, the changes in
APDU are smaller (<23 msec) since this range cor-
responds to the flat portion of the APD restitution
curve (Figure 15). Therefore, the decrease in APDu
from beat 1 to beat 2 results in a relatively small
increase in the recovery time to beat 3. This recovery
time is too small to compensate for the large initial
value of X at the onset of beat 2. As a result, Xs
increases monotonically from beat to beat and no
alternans are observed.

It should be emphasized that the large changes in
APDU at short BCL reflect large changes in APD.
This is because at short BCL the stimuli are applied
during a fast-recovery phase of the APD restitution
curve (Figure 15). In contrast, for long BCL, the
stimuli are applied during a slow phase of the resti-
tution curve (Figure 15), resulting in small changes in
APD. Consequently, for long BCL, APDu changes
are determined by changes in tu (except for beat 1 to
beat 2, where APD also changes significantly as
described above). Starting from beat 2 changes in
APDU are determined by tu alone (since APD ap-
proaches a constant value). As shown in Figure 18,
the increase in tu starting from beat 2 results in a
monotonic increase in APDu and a progressively
shorter recovery time between beats until activation
failure occurs. The result of this progressive decrease
in membrane excitability is the appearance of non-
integer S:R patterns (such as 8:7, 7:6, 6:5, etc.)
between 1: 1 and 2: 1 and all other integer S: R ratios.
These noninteger S: R patterns are observed over a
BCL interval of 2 msec. In contrast, for short BCL,
noninteger S: R patterns are not observed in our
simulations and there is a direct transition from 1: 1
to 2: 1 (and between all other integer S: R ratios).
This is because for short BCL APDU changes are
dominated by the large changes in APD (and not by
tu). Under these conditions, the recovery time does

not decrease progressively from beat to beat since the
shortest recovery time is between beat 1 and beat 2.
This is because APDu is determined by APD, and
APD of beat 1 is the longest since it occurs after a
recovery time of 2 BCL. Therefore, if activation is
successful at beat 2, all subsequent stimuli result in
successful responses and a 1:1 pattern is established.
As described above, this 1:1 pattern is characterized
by alternans in APD. However, if activation failure
occurs, it always occurs at beat 2, where recovery
time is the shortest. The result is a direct transition
from a 1: 1 to 2: 1 pattern without the possibility for
noninteger S: R patterns.

Supernormality and Rate-Dependent Activation

The Wenckebach activation patterns discussed
above were obtained in the setting of normal extra-
cellular potassium concentration ([K]o>4.6 mM), for
which supernormal excitability does not exist. For
low extracellular potassium concentration, supernor-
mal excitability appears during or immediately after
the action potential repolarization phase (see "Su-
pernornal Excitability"). Since the presence of super-
normality modifies the- strength-interval curve by

introducing nonmonotonic recovery of excitability,
we expect rate-dependent activation patterns under
conditions of low [K]. to be different from the regular
rhythms for normal [K]o discussed in the previous
section. Recently, complex response patterns were
observed experimentally by Chialvo et a17 in Purkinje
fibers at low extracellular potassium concentrations
([K]0=4 mM). In this section, we will use the L-R
model to simulate and investigate this phenomenon.
The strength-interval curve computed for [K]0=4
mM and a test stimulus of 20-msec duration is
plotted in Figure 20A. The horizontal dotted line
indicates the current amplitude of the stimuli during
repetitive stimulation. For this level of stimulation
(3.13 ,A), four different regions of S1S2 interval exist,
as characterized by their responses. Regions 1 and 3
are excitable, whereas regions 2 and 4 are inexcitable.
Note that excitable and inexcitable regions alternate,
so that excitable regions are separated by an inexcit-
able region. Figure 20B depicts the APDu restitution
curve for the same conditions. The same four regions
are identified. Note the discontinuity of this curve in
region 2, corresponding to the inexcitable region in
Figure 20A. Also, APDu is almost constant in region
1, while in region 3 a fast rate of change is observed.
This fast change of APDu is caused by the relatively
fast decrease of the X gate during this phase (see
"Wenckebach Periodicity and Channel Behavior").

The results of a simulated repetitive stimulation
experiment with the stimulus strength indicated in
Figure 20A (current amplitude of 3.13 ,uA) are shown
as the staircase plot of the R: S ratio versus BCL of
stimulation (Figure 21). Numbers in the figure indi-
cate the S: R ratios. This format is the same as that for
Figure 16B, which was obtained for [K]0=5.4 mM, in
the absence of supernormality. A comparison of these
figures clearly demonstrates that the activation pat-
terns are different under these two different condi-

normality present) (Figure 21). Under these condi-

observed for a BCL of 500, 438, and 428 msec. These
regions are separated by regions of 2: 1 patterns.

The nonmonotonic regions of Figure 21 are ampli-
fied in Figures 22A and 23A. In Figure 22A, as BCL
is decreased from 465 msec the activation pattern
changes from 1:1 to 2:1 at a BCL of 458 msec and
then returns to the 1:1 pattern at a BCL of 439 msec.
This nonmonotonic transition from 2: 1 to 1: 1 is
possible because of the nonmonotonic strength-in-
terval curve (supernormality) of Figure 20A. The 2: 1
pattern in Figure 22A occurs over a range of BCLs
(between 458 and 440 msec) that corresponds to
region 2 of the strength-interval curve (Figure 20A).
A stimulus at this region fails to elicit a response so
that the next stimulus occurs at 2 BCL in region 1 of
the strength-interval curve, resulting in a successful
response. A 2:1 pattern is thus established (see the
first row in Figure 22B). The 1:1 pattern of activation
for BCLs between 439 and 433 msec is also shown in
Figure 22B (second row). The first action potential is
of maximum duration because it is stimulated from a
fully recovered membrane. The second stimulus is
applied during the supernormal phase (region 3 in
Figure 20A) and displays a shorter duration. This is
because the stimulus is timed during the fast decreas-
ing phase of the restitution curve (point a in Figure
20B). As a result, a longer recovery time follows this
action potential and the third stimulus is applied in
region 1 of the strength-interval curve (Figure 20A).
However, the duration of the third action potential
(point al in Figure 20B) is still shorter than that of
the first action potential, obtained under fully recov-
ered conditions. Consequently, the recovery time is
longer and all subsequent stimuli are applied in
region 1 of the strength-interval curve, resulting in a
1:1 pattern. For a further decrease in BCL, the
pattern returns to 2:1 (BCL of 432 msec), and then
back to 1:1 (BCL of 428 msec). These two patterns
are shown in Figure 22B (third and fourth rows,
respectively). For a BCL of 432 msec, the second
action potential is of short duration, corresponding to
point b on the restitution curve of Figure 20B (note
that the APDu at b is smaller than that at point a).
The following stimulus elicits an action potential of
duration (bl) on the restitution curve (bl>al). As a
result, the next stimulus is timed during region 2 of
the strength-interval curve and does not elicit a
successful response. A 2:1 pattern is thus estab-
lished. For a BCL of 428 msec (see Figure 22B) the
second response is of a very short duration, corre-
sponding to point c in Figure 20B. The following
stimulus is applied after a long recovery time, result-
ing in an action potential of long duration (point cl in
Figure 20B). As a result, the next stimulus is applied
in region 2 of the strength-interval curve and fails to
elicit an action potential. This event is followed by a
long recovery time and an action potential of long
duration so that the next stimulus is timed during the
supernormal phase (region 3) of the strength-inter-
val curve, resulting in a successful response of short
duration. After these transitional events the pattern

is similar to that obtained for a BCL of 436 msec (see
Figure 22B), and a ratio of 1:1 is established. A
similar interplay between the excitability and APD at
the different regions defined in Figures 20A and 20B
determines the various patterns as BCL is further
decreased.

In Figure 23A, as the BCL is reduced below 205
msec, irregular activation patterns are observed. An
example is shown in Figure 23B for a BCL of 200.4
msec (arrow in panel A). For this particular BCL,
unstable patterns are observed and no regular peri-
odicity is established for more than 250 consecutive
stimuli. This behavior is consistent with the experi-
mental findings of Chialvo et al,7 who observed highly
aperiodic activity (termed "chaotic activity") at a
BCL of 200 msec with no repeated patterns for
recording periods that encompassed 100 or more
stimuli. In our simulations, after a transient chaotic
pattern that lasted more than 250 consecutive stimuli
a very complex pattern with very long periodicity of
about 13 seconds (67 stimuli) was established.

The highly aperiodic activity occurs at a BCL
below 205 msec. For this range of BCL, the stimuli
are frequently applied during region 3 of the
strength-interval curve (supernormal phase). In this
region, the APD depends very strongly on the time of
stimulation. In fact, APDu changes by 281 msec over
an S1S2 interval of 15 msec (Figure 20B). As a result,
a small change in the time of stimulation during the
supernormal phase can cause a very large change in
the duration of the elicited action potential and in
the timing of the next stimulus. Consequently, small
variations in the time of stimulation in region 3 can
shift the timing of the next stimulus between different

regions of the strength-interval curve, eliciting a very
different response. This high sensitivity to the timing
of stimulation ("initial conditions") is the basis for
the unstable patterns ("chaotic activity"). It should
be noted that at a BCL between 410 and 465 msec
nonmonotonic behavior of the activation patterns is
also observed. However, for this range of BCL there
are no unstable patterns or aperiodic activity. This is
because for the longer BCL, the stimuli are infre-
quently applied during region 3 of the strength-
interval curve (supernormal phase). Moreover, a
stimulus during region 3 is never followed by another
stimulus in the same region. The next stimulus always
falls either in region 2 (activation failure) or in region
1 (the flat portion of the restitution curve, Figure
20B). On the flat portion of the restitution curve,
small changes in the time of the stimulation can
cause only very small changes in APD. This has a
stabilizing effect on the response so that irregular
activity and unstable patterns do not occur.

To further elucidate the ionic current behavior dur-
ing the highly aperiodic activity, in Figure 24 we plotted
the magnitude of INa and ISi that corresponds to the
pattern shown in Figure 23B, second row from the top.
An important observation is that most of the responses
during the complex patterns do not involve the fast
sodium channel and depolarization is caused by Isi. In
Figure 23B, F identifies an activation failure during the
plateau of an action potential that was initiated in
region 1 of the strength-interval curve. A successful
activation during the plateau of an action potential that
was initiated in region 3 of the strength-interval curve
is identified by S in the figure. The corresponding
events in the Isi curve are also identified by F and S,
respectively (Figure 24). The difference between the
peak magnitudes of Isi for these two events is very small
(0.2 ,lA). However, the total outward current
(IK1(T)+IK) at F is 3.93 gA as compared with only 2.35
,uA at S. This decrease is mostly due to reduced 'Kl(T) at
the lower membrane potential of S and results in a
successful response, bringing about a very complex
pattern of activation. It should be mentioned that this
behavior involves the negative slope characteristic of
the IK1(T) curve (Figure 3). When we eliminate the
negative slope in the IK1(T) curve (not shown), unstable
patterns do not appear.

Discussion

The goal of this study is to construct a model of the
membrane action potential of the mammalian ven-
tricular cell based, whenever possible, on recent
experimental findings in single-cell and single-chan-
nel studies. In this report we reformulate three ionic
currents: INa, IK, and IKI(T). INa is inactivated by two
processes-fast and slow. The slow process of inac-
tivation also implies slow recovery of excitability. In
addition, INa is characterized by a large channel
conductance resulting in fast upstroke velocity
(Vmax=400 V/sec) of the action potential. A newly
discovered potassium channel that activates at high
potentials is implemented as a component of IK1(T) in

the model. [K], dependence of 'K and IKI(T) is a major
feature of the model. This enables us to simulate
various phenomena that involve changes in [K],. In
this paper we focus on the rising phase, the late
repolarization phase, and the postrepolarization
phase of the action potential. We use the model to
investigate phenomena that involve INa, IK' and IK(T)
during these phases such as supernormal excitability,
membrane responsiveness, and Wenckebach perio-
dicity. The results are consistent with the experimen-
tal observations, and the phenomena are well de-
scribed in terms of ionic channel behavior. It should
be emphasized that the present model does not
include ionic pumps and exchange mechanisms. It
therefore cannot simulate dynamic changes in ionic
concentrations. The slow inward current in the model
is adopted from the B-R model and is not consistent
with recent findings related to calcium currents
through the membrane such as the existence of two
types of calcium channels, L and T, and the role
played by [Ca]i in inactivation. Also, while an uptake
mechanism of intracellular calcium is represented in
the model, the model cannot simulate intracellular
calcium transients that result from the interaction
between calcium currents through the sarcolemma
and calcium release and uptake by the sarcoplasmic
reticulum. A second phase of the ventricular model
presented here is currently being developed in our
laboratory to include all of these processes based on
recent experimental data. Such processes were first
incorporated in a model of the Purkinje action po-
tential by DiFrancesco and Nobles in 1985.

We use the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism to describe
the macroscopic (ensemble) behavior of ionic channels.
This choice is consistent with (and dictated by) our
goal, namely, the reconstruction of the membrane
action potential that results from ensemble currents
through many individual channels. However, one
should practice caution when extrapolating from the
ensemble behavior to the single-channel behavior, es-
pecially when the cardiac sodium channel kinetics are
considered. While many single sodium channel proper-
ties correspond to similar characteristics of the ensem-
ble current4344 and are adequately described by the
Hodgkin-Huxley kinetics, some properties are not. For
example, at potentials near threshold for sodium chan-
nel activation, both channel activation and inactivation
determine the kinetics of the macroscopic sodium
current decay (i.e., current inactivation).4445 The mi-
croscopic behavior of ionic channels other than the
sodium channels can be adequately described by the
Hodgkin-Huxley kinetics.26,30

For the sake of clarity, the discussion below is
divided into modeling aspects and physiological sim-
ulation aspects of the study.
Modeling Considerations

INa: Fast sodium current. The fast upstroke velocity
of the action potential has been measured in single
cells.13,46,47 The Vmax measured by Brown et al'3 is in

the range of 200-300 V/sec at 20-22Â°C. By applying
a minimum Qlo of 1.23,48 Vma is at least 272-410
V/sec at 37Â°C. Vm. of the E-J model is 300 V/sec,
while it is 400 V/sec if computed by the L-R model.
The faster upstroke in the L-R model results from
adjusting the reversal potential from 29 mV (E-I
model) to 54.4 mV to reflect the different intracellu-
lar sodium concentration in mammals ([Na]i= 18
mM)13'23 and chicken embryos ([Na]i=40 mM).25
This adjustment gives Vma~x=400 V/sec in the range of
measured values. It also results in an overshoot (41.7
mV) of the action potential that is in good agreement
with the experimental findings in guinea pig ventric-
ular cells.31,35

A tetrodotoxin (YTX)-sensitive slow sodium cur-
rent that affects the action potential duration has
been identified in single-channel recordings.49-52 In
guinea pig ventricular cells, a low dose of TTX (.30
gM) does not affect the APD significantly.35,53 How-
ever, Kiyosue and Arita,52 using a high dose of TTX
(60 ,uM), observed -10% shortening of the APD.
This slow current is different from the window cur-
rent caused by the overlap of the M3n. and h. curves at
high potentials,51,52 as demonstrated by the fact that
TTX can affect the APD with little (or no) change in
Vmax.9,54 The kinetics of this slow current are still not
completely elucidated, and it is not included in the
L-R model. We will have to include this channel in
future studies (as more data become available),
especially if effects of drugs are to be studied (some
local anesthetics can affect this current).

Two time constants (fast and slow) better describe
the inactivation of the sodium channel.13'49'50'55'56
This cannot be described by the Hodgkin-Huxley
kinetics with one inactivation gate. Similar to Beeler
and Reuter we incorporated two Hodgkin-Huxley-
type inactivation gates as suggested by Haas et al.24
Haas et a124 proposed that two inactivation gates (h
and j in the L-R model) with different time constants
can describe the macroscopic behavior of the sodium
current inactivation. Following this strategy, the L-R
model correctly simulated the behavior of the sodium
channel observed experimentally (Figures 7 and 8).
Without slow recovery from inactivation (a property
not included in the E-J model or in the DiFrancesco-
Noble model) INa recovery from inactivation follows
the same time course following different periods of
inactivation (Figure 7D). This is inconsistent with the
experimental observations (Figure 7A) by Ebihara et
al.36 Also, without slow recovery from inactivation,
the fast recovery of INa results in an unrealistically
fast recovery of excitability at a high level of mem-
brane potential during the repolarization phase of an
action potential (Figure 8D). Note that a conserva-
tive value of rj was used in our simulations. We used
a maximum rj of -80 msec at V= -65 mV. Values as
high as 200 msec were reported in the literature.14

To account for this process of slow recovery from
inactivation, alternative models to that of Hodgkin
and Huxley were proposed to describe an inactiva-
tion gate with two time constants (fast and slow).

Chiu57 proposed a modified Hodgkin-Huxley formal-
ism (second-order kinetics) to describe two processes
of inactivation. However, Brown et al13 found that
the h,(V) curve can be described by a single expo-
nential, a result that is also supported by the recent
observations for single-channel recordings.44 This
deviates from the prediction of Chiu's model57 that
h, has to be described by two exponentials as a
function of voltage. Recently, Markov chain models
have been proposed to describe the sodium channel
kinetics in cardiac cells.58 Based on single-channel
recordings and a five-state Markov model,59 Scanley
et a145 provided a kinetic analysis of the sodium
channel. The basic five-state model reproduced ob-
served open-duration data and reopening behavior
but produced only a single exponential decay of
current, implying that more complex models are
required.

Single-channel recordings demonstrate that near-
threshold potentials for channel activation sodium
channels tend to open more than once during a
depolarization (reopening phenomenon44'45). Also, a
significant fraction of sodium channels do not open
by the time of peak inward current. These micro-
scopic phenomena determine the time course of the
macroscopic current decay and provide the basis for
the slow macroscopic current inactivation that is
introduced in our model by the j gate.

IK: Time-dependent potassium current. The formu-
lation of IK in our model is based on the form
suggested by Shibasaki26 to fit his data in nodal cells,
but its parameters are obtained from the B-R model
of the ventricular action potential. Note that the
property of [K]O-dependent activation is introduced
as a square root dependence of the maximum con-
ductance. In contrast, the DiFrancesco-Noble formu-
lation5 results in a linear dependence of channel
conductance on [K]. in the physiological range of
[K]O from 2 to 10 mM. The simulated results (Figure
1) are consistent with the experimental findings by
McDonald and Trautwein29 and Shibasaki26 and in-
clude minimal crossover between current-voltage
curves of different [K], and strong inward rectifica-
tion. An alternative formulation could be constructed
from the data measured by Matsuura et a127 in guinea
pig single ventricular cells. They measured the fully
activated IK curve [IK(V)I for [K]0=5.4 mM and
proposed that K='K@X2 (IK activation is propor-
tional to the second power of the activation gate, X).
We introduced [K]0 dependence in their formulation
and investigated the behavior of IK for different
values of [K]O. The results displayed significant cross-
over between IK curves of different [K]O. This is
inconsistent with the experimental observations.26'29
We then introduced this alternative formulation of IK
in the L-R model of the action potential. Since the
surface membrane area was not given by Matsuura et
al,27 we adjusted the maximum conductance (GK)
based on the mean capacitive membrane area mea-
sured by Isenberg and Klockner (2x 0-4 cm2/cell)3'
and Kamp et al (8.52x 10`- cm2/cell).60 This resulted

in GK-0.143 mS/cm2 and GK=0.335 mS/cm2, respec-
tively, in comparison with the L-R GK=0.282 mS/cm2.
Note that specific capacitance of 1 bLF/cm~ is as-
sumed. The (adjusted) alternative 'K failed to repo-
larize the membrane when [K] '.4.5 mM (for
GK=0.143 mS/cm2) and [K],.<2.2 mM (for GK=0.335
mS/cm2), and the membrane potential stayed at
about -30 to -40 mV. This is inconsistent with the
experimental observations at low [K],. Tseng et a19
observed repolarization at [K]0=2 mM but not at
[KE0=1 mM. This behavior is simulated correctly by
the L-R IK in
spite of its smaller conductance
(GK<0.335 mS/cm2). This inability of the Matsuura et
a127 IK to repolarize the membrane in spite of the
large conductance results from the X2 dependence of
IK. For these reasons we formulated the L-R IK to
depend on X (rather than X2), as suggested by
Shibasaki.26 It should be emphasized, however, that
the behavior of IK was demonstrated in a model that
retains the slow inward current formulation of the
B-R model. The Matsuura 'K will have to be reexam-
fined once an accurate model of 'Ca is developed.

IK1(T)

Total time-independent potassium current.
This current is equivalent to IK'
in the B-R model3
and is renamed here IK1(T) based on the following
recent findings. In single-channel recordings, Kura-
chi30 found that 1) an inactivation gate (K1) of IKi is
a function of membrane potential and of the potas-
sium Nernst potential and 2) this gate completely
inactivates at plateau potentials, resulting in zero 'I
current at these potentials. The zero contribution of
IK1 at plateau potentials was also observed by Isen-
berg32 and Shah et al.34 Therefore, the total (non-
zero) time-independent potassium current (IK1(T)) at
high (plateau) potentials must result from current
through other channels. Kakei et a161 and Jijima and
Taira62 found that the shortening of the APD caused
by potassium channel agonists (nicorandil and pina-
cidil) is a result of increasing the current only at high
potentials. This observation supports the Yue and
Marban12 discovery of a plateau potassium channel
(1KP) that activates only at high potentials. This
channel is characterized by a much smaller time
constant than 'K, no detectable inactivation for more
than 600 msec, and high selectivity to potassium ions.
Also, the maximum conductance (GKP) is largely in-
sensitive to changes in [K]O. This insensitivity is con-
sistent with the experimental observations by Isenberg
and Klockner (Figure 8 of Reference 8), Sakmann and
Trube (Figure 4A of Reference 11), and Tseng et al
(Figure 2A of Reference 9) in whole-cell recordings.
They observed that the current-voltage curves of IK(T)
for different values of [K]O (1-22 mM) overlap at high
potentials. This overlap implies that the plateau cur-
rents are insensitive to changes in [K], According to
the observations described above, 1K1 contributes no
current at plateau potentials and 'Kp can be treated as
a component of IK1(T) that is activated only at plateau
potentials. Also, a background current (1b) exists at
negative potentials after blocking IKI 32-34 Therefore,

IK1(T) consists of at least three currents (IK1, IKP, and
Ib). We represent the IKI(T) as the sum of these three
currents to fit the data measured by Sakmann and
Trube (Figure 4A of Reference 11) and obtain an
excellent fit for all values of [K],0 (Figure 3). It is of
interest to note that the negative slope of the simu-
lated IK1(T) is smaller than that measured by Kurachi30
in single-channel recordings. However, the L-R re-
sult is consistent with the experimental observations
in multicellular32,63 and single-cell8,9,34 recordings.
Note that the property of [K]0-dependent activation
is introduced as a square root dependence of the
maximum conductance.10,11 This behavior is different
from the linear dependence on [K]0 over the physio-
logical range in the DiFrancesco-Noble formulation
([K]c< <Km,1 in their Equation 13).,-
Physiological Simulations

Membrane response to premature stimulation. Pre-
mature stimulation can be used to investigate the
recovery of membrane excitability during the repo-
larization phase of an action potential. The simula-
tions show that the premature membrane response,
indicated by Vma measured in mammalian ventricu-
lar cells,14 is well represented by the L-R model
(Figure 8). We define the absolute refractory period
as the range of membrane potential for which stim-
ulation will result in Vmax that is smaller than 20% of
the fully recovered Vmaya The result (V> -78 mV) of
the L-R model (Figure 8B) that incorporates the
process of slow recovery from inactivation is very
close to the experimental data (>-76 mV, Figure
8A). In the absence of slow recovery from inactiva-
tion (E-J model, Figure 8D), the simulation result
(V> -69 mV) deviates significantly from the experi-
mental data. Similar behavior is expected from all
models of the sodium channel that do not incorpo-
rate the process of slow recovery from inactivation
(e.g., Drouhard and Roberge64). This comparison
demonstrates the importance of the process of slow
recovery from inactivation in determining the time
course of recovery of membrane excitability during
repolarization. Since during repolarization j is almost
completely inactivated and since irj> > ih, it follows
that the membrane responsiveness is controlled by
the slow inactivation j gate. Our simulations also
demonstrate the importance of incorporating the
correct steady-state characteristics of INa inactivation
[h.(V) and ja(V)] in the model. The steady-state
behavior predicted by the B-R model deviates from
the experimental behavior of cardiac fibers (compare
curve 2 in Figures 8C and 8A), whereas the L-R
model (based on the INa data from mammalian
ventricular cells) simulates the experimental behav-
ior correctly. It is also important to incorporate the
correct GN,. The B-R model (GNa=4 mS/Cm2) pre-
dicts a Vmax that is unrealistically slow (115 V/sec),
while the L-R model (GNa=23 mS/cm2) predicts a
V7.
within the range of measured values (400 V/sec).
Note that a GNa increase by a factor of almost 6
results in a Vm.X increase by a factor of about 3. This

is because the actual rate of activation of the cardiac
sodium channel (represented in the L-R model) is
slower than the rate of activation used in the B-R
model (modified from squid-axon data). The unreal-
istic low GNa of the B-R model also leads to an
unrealistically long latency from threshold potential
to Vm, (Figure 6D) that is inconsistent with the
experimental findings.28
So far, we have considered the membrane response
at a normal [K]0 ([K]0=5.4 mM). The L-R model
allows changes in extracellular potassium concentra-
tion to be incorporated. We studied the membrane
response to premature stimulation for different [K],.
The strength-interval curve is determined by the
critical (minimum) strength of test stimuli needed to
excite the membrane during the repolarization phase
of an action potential. Experimentally, the stimulus
strength decreases monotonically with repolarization
at normal [K]O; however, supernormal excitability has
been identified as an interval in which nonmonotonic
behavior of the strength-interval curve occurs at low
[K]0.7,39 The results (Figure 9) of the L-R model
simulations are consistent with the experimental ob-
servations. For [K]o>4.6 mM, the threshold potential
decreases during repolarization at a rate that is faster
than the rate of repolarization (Figure 12). As a result,
membrane excitability increases monotonically during
repolarization. For low [K]0 ([K]04.6 mM) there is a
range during late repolarization at which the rate of
membrane repolarization is faster than the decrease
of threshold potential (Figure 12).38 This results in a
decrease of excitability over this range and, therefore,
in a nonmonotonic recovery of membrane excitability
(Figure 9). The presence of an interval during which
excitability is higher than in the adjacent (previous
and following) intervals is known as "supernormality."'
At the level of channel kinetics, this behavior is a
consequence of different kinetics of slow recovery
from inactivation of INa at different values of [K]O. As
[K]0 decreases from 7 to 3 mM, resting potential
(primarily controlled by IK1), becomes more negative
(from - 78.2 to - 95.5 mV) so that the time constant of
sodium channel recovery, dominated by the slow
inactivation j gate, becomes smaller (ij decreases from
33 to 7 msec). As a result, the sodium channel recovers
earlier in the repolarization phase at a range for which
repolarization is faster than the rate of decrease of
threshold potential, and a supernormal window is
created. The interaction between lKl and slow recov-
ery from inactivation of INa in response to changes in
[K]O determines the amplitude and width of the win-
dow of supernormal excitability (Figure 9). Without
the process of slow recovery from inactivation, the
sodium channel recovers unrealistically earlier so that
supernormality is observed even when [K]0 is as high
as 7 mM (Figure 1lA). This is inconsistent with the
experimental observations.7'39
Periodic stimulation at normal [K]0. Wenckebach
rate-dependent block was originally characterized as
a propagation-related process that involves decre-
mental conduction. Wenckebach65 described this

phenomenon in the atrioventricular node. Wencke-
bach periodicity was also demonstrated in cardiac
tissue that contained a region of depressed conduc-
tion separating two regions of normal excitability.66
Recently, Wenckebach periodicity was demonstrated
in a single ventricular cell under periodic stimula-
tion,6,40 indicating that the phenomenon is an intrin-
sic property of the cell membrane. Using the L-R
model at normal [K]O (5.4 mM), we investigated the
cellular mechanism of the periodic rate-dependent
block. The simulations demonstrate that this process
is dominated by the kinetics of the X gate of IK. This
is because membrane excitability is influenced to a
large extent by the loss of charge to the extracellular
medium through the IK channel during stimuli of
relatively long duration (20 msec) (see Figures 13 and
14).

As the BCL of periodic stimulation decreases from
2,000 msec, a monotonic decrease of the R: S ratio is
observed (staircase in Figure 16B). In our simula-
tions, noninteger patterns of S: R ratios are observed
in the transition interval between integer S: R ratios.
For example, noninteger Wenckebach patterns (8:7,
7:6, 6:5, etc.) are found between 1: 1 and 2: 1 (Figure
16B). These patterns are observed in a very narrow
interval of about 2 msec. The fact that these patterns
occur over such a narrow time interval might be the
reason why these various Wenckebach patterns could
not be sustained in single myocyte preparations2840
since small perturbations (e.g., in temperature and
pipette resistance) can cause large changes relative
to the narrow transition range. In multicellular prep-
arations7,65,66 the transition intervals are longer (up
to 100 msec) and stable noninteger Wenckebach
patterns are observed.

The appearance of Wenckebach block patterns is
related to beat-to-beat changes in APD (measured
from Vma, to 90% repolarization) and the latency
from onset of stimulation to Vma. Both parameters
are controlled by the degree of IK deactivation (ki-
netics of the X gate). For long BCL (BCL>920
msec), APD of all beats in a Wenckebach pattern
remains almost constant (see Figure 15), while the
latency increases progressively so that deactivation
time (BCL-APD-latency) of the X gate decreases
monotonically, bringing about a progressive beat-to-
beat decrease of membrane excitability. This process
continues until activation failure occurs. This is the
typical (classical) Wenckebach rate-dependent block
observed in cardiac Purkinje fibers7 and in single
ventricular myocytes.640 When BCL decreases (920
msec.BCL>700 msec), the pattern of beat-to-beat
changes becomes different from the typical behavior
described above. APD does not remain constant, and
recovery time first increases (from second to third
beat) and then decreases monotonically. However,
membrane excitability still decreases monotonically
from beat to beat until activation failure occurs. This
is because the beat-to-beat increase in the value of

the X gate at the time of stimulation more than
compensates for the initial increase in recovery time
(see Figure 18). This atypical (nonmonotonic) behav-
ior of recovery time can be observed in the data of
Delmar et a16 for stimulation at BCL=910 msec. A
careful inspection of Figure lB in their paper dem-
onstrates that total APD (APD+latency) of the first
beat in a Wenckebach pattern is greater than that of
the second beat; also, the value of plateau potential is
decreased. These experimental findings are consis-
tent with the simulations presented here (Figures 17
and 18).

When BCL further decreases (<560 msec), the
increase in the value of the X gate (i.e., degree of IK
activation) does not compensate for the initial in-
crease in recovery time. As a result, membrane excit-
ability increases at the time of the next stimulus,
resulting in an action potential of long duration. This
implies a shorter recovery time and lower membrane
excitability at the time of the following stimulus, so
that the following action potential is of short duration.
A pattern of beat-to-beat alternans in APD is thus
established. The amplitude of alternans (see Figure
19) decreases monotonically until a stable activation
pattern (1:1) with constant APD (smaller than that of
the fully recovered action potential) is established.
Noninteger Wenckebach patterns cannot be found
when alternans occur. This is consistent with the
experimental observations (at BCL=430 msec) in
isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes.67 The reason is
that both phenomena (noninteger Wenckebach pat-
terns and alternans) cannot occur simultaneously.
Alternans occur at small BCL, at a range where there
is a strong dependence of APD on the time of
stimulation (Figure 15), reflecting a strong depen-
dence of the X gate deactivation on the time of
stimulation. At this range, the changes in APD are
much larger than changes in the latency from stimulus
to Vmax, so that the recovery time is determined by
APD. Since the first beat is of the longest APD (a fully
recovered action potential), the recovery time to the
second beat is the shortest and all following stimula-
tions will be successful. Hence, a 1: 1 pattern is always
established when alternans are present. In contrast,
noninteger Wenckebach patterns are established at a
range of BCL for which large beat-to-beat changes in
the latency from stimulus to Vmax and small changes in
APD are present. At this range, recovery time is
determined by the latency from stimulus to Vmax,
which increases monotonically from beat to beat. The
result is a monotonically decreasing recovery time
leading to block. Delmar et a128 used the B-R model
with modified IKI to investigate the Wenckebach phe-
nomenon for long BCL. The simulated transition
interval during which noninteger Wenckebach pat-
terns were observed was longer than 20 msec. With
such a long interval, one expects that systematic
measurements of Wenckebach patterns in single cells
will reveal persistent noninteger ratios. This is incon-
sistent with experimental observations.6.28,40

Periodic stimulation at low [K],. The L-R model
incorporates the possibility of changing [K]0. We
studied the effects of changes in [K], on the cell
response to periodic stimulation. At low [K]0 the
nonmonotonic behavior of the strength-interval
curve (Figure 20A) allows stimuli to excite the mem-
brane during the supernormal phase but not at
adjacent (earlier or later) intervals. This discontinu-
ity in excitability together with the high sensitivity of
APD to the time of stimulation (Figure 20B) during
the supernormal phase brings about nonmonotonic
behavior of the R:S curve and unstable activation
patterns (Figure 21). This complex behavior was
observed experimentally and described in a recent
paper by Chialvo et al.7 For long BCL (.410 msec),
stimulation is seldom timed during the supernormal
phase. As a result, stable but complex activation
patterns are observed (such as 10:6, 12:8, 6:4, and
20:11). Also, the same activation patterns are re-
peated at different ranges of BCL (nonmonotonic
staircase behavior, see Figure 22). For short BCL
(<205 msec), stimulation is frequently timed during
the supernormal phase. Consequently, highly aperi-
odic patterns that do not stabilize for more than 250
consecutive stimuli are observed (Figure 23). This is
consistent with the experimental findings of Chialvo
et al.7 A very small change in BCL (from 200.4 to
200.7 msec) results in very different patterns, indicat-
ing very high sensitivity to initial conditions. The
unstable patterns are frequently characterized by
successful activations during the early repolarization
phase of an action potential. This action potential
was initiated by a stimulus applied during the super-
normal phase. It is characterized by low plateau
potentials, in the range where IKI(T) exhibits a nega-
tive slope. The decrease of IK1(T) with depolarization
at this range results in higher membrane excitability
and a possibility of successful activation during the
early repolarization phase of an action potential. It
should be noted that when we eliminate the negative
slope in the current-voltage curve of IKI(T), the unsta-
ble aperiodic patterns disappear. Also, the successful
activation at this range is a "slow response" caused
by activation of 'Si and not of INa. Similar unstable
aperiodic patterns were predicted by an analytic
(difference-differential) model formulated by Chi-
alvo et al.7 Their model is based on the relations
between excitability, latency, and APD. They show
that the appearance of aperiodic patterns is related
to the presence of supernormality and to the shape of
the APD restitution curve at short diastolic intervals.
These observations are consistent with the behavior
of our membrane model and, as elucidated by our
simulations, reflect both large changes in the state of
deactivation of the IK channel (X gate) and the
negative slope characteristic of IK1I(T)
In summary, the membrane model developed here
correctly simulates various phenomena that result
from the interaction of excitation and repolarization.
This is an important property of the model since
reentrant arrhythmias involve this type of interaction

between head and tail of the reentrant action poten-
tial.17 Another property of the model is the ability to
introduce changes in [K]. This is also an important
aspect of the model since elevated [K],
is an impor-
tant aspect of ischemia that influences propagation
and arrhythmogenesis.

The simulations of membrane response to prema-
ture stimulation predict a variety of rate-dependent
phenomena. These include Wenckebach periodicity,
beat-to-beat alternans of APD, and (because of super-
normality at low [K]0) unstable aperiodic response
patterns that display high sensitivity to initial condi-
tions. The occurrence of Wenckebach periodicity in
our simulations support other observations that this
phenomenon is an intrinsic property of single cardiac
cells. This observation suggests that the single-cell
response under a variety of conditions might play an
important role in arrhythmogenesis. The occurrence
of beat-to-beat alternans in the simulations is intrigu-
ing. Beat-to-beat alternans in APD are a property of
reentrant action potentials.17,68 In a broader sense,
electrical alternans are detected in many circum-
stances that are associated with ventricular fibrillation
and, as suggested by Guevara et al,67 may reflect the
first in a cascade of period-doubling bifurcations that
eventually result in chaos, that is, fibrillation.69 As with
Wenckebach periodicity, the observation that alter-
nans can be generated at the level of the single cell
points to the possible important role of the single-cell
response in arrhythmogenesis. Finally, the appearance
of highly aperiodic patterns that are extremely sensi-
tive to initial conditions might also be related to
arrhythmogenesis since it implies that short propaga-
tion delays (-1 msec) can initiate very different
responses in neighboring cells (or multicellular fiber
bundles). Note that propagation delays of this magni-
tude can occur across gap junctions under a very
moderate degree of cell-to-cell uncoupling.1516 We
conclude with a word of caution. The behaviors de-
scribed above are the responses of isolated cells. In
the heart, the behavior of cells is modulated by loading
conditions and electrotonic interactions.70 The re-
sponse of a cell in an ensemble may, therefore, be
different from its intrinsic response. Under conditions
of increased cell-to-cell uncoupling the individual re-
sponse of cells (or of a group of cells, i.e., fiber
bundles) may become unmasked, bringing about con-
ditions that favor arrhythmogenesis. Verification of
these hypotheses awaits further experimentation in
multicellular preparations and simulations in a multi-
cellular model of cardiac tissue.
