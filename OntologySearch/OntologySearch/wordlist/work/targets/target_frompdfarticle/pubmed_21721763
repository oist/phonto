We propose an analog-digital hybrid circuit model of one-dimensional cardiac tissue with
hardware implementation that allows us to perform real-time simulations of spatially conducting
cardiac action potentials. Each active nodal compartment of the tissue model is designed using
analog circuits and a dsPIC microcontroller, by which the time-dependent and time-independent
nonlinear current-voltage relationships of six types of ion channel currents employed in the Luo-
Rudy phase I (LR-I) model for a single mammalian cardiac ventricular cell can be reproduced
quantitatively. Here, we perform real-time simulations of reentrant excitation conduction in a ring-
shaped tissue model that includes eighty nodal compartments. In particular, we show that the
hybrid tissue model can exhibit real-time dynamics for initiation of reentries induced by uni-
directional block, as well as those for phase resetting that leads to annihilation of the reentry in
response to impulsive current stimulations at appropriate nodes and timings. The dynamics of the
hybrid model are comparable to those of a spatially distributed tissue model with LR-I
compartments. Thus, it is conceivable that the hybrid model might be a useful tool for large scale
simulations of cardiac tissue dynamics, as an alternative to numerical simulations, leading toward
further understanding of the reentrant mechanisms. VC 2011 American Institute of Physics.

Dysfunction of electrical excitations and their spatial
propagation in cardiac myocytes can induce abnormal
contractions of the heart,
leading to life threatening
arrhythmias. Some arrhythmias are perpetuated by
reentrant mechanisms, in which a local excitation con-
ducts through a part of the heart to recirculate back to
the original site. This reentry cycle time can be shorter
than the normal cycle of a cardiac pacemaker, leading
to the rapid heart beat referred to as a reentrant tachy-
cardia. To better understand electrophysiological mech-
anisms of the reentrant arrhythmias at the cellular,
tissue, and organ levels, mathematical models of cardiac
cells, tissues, and the heart have been developed in order
to simulate the propagation of excitations in a variety of
conditions. However, it is inevitable for those models to
become large scale in the number of dynamical varia-
bles, requiring immense amounts of computational time
for their dynamic simulations. Here, we introduce an
analog-digital hybrid circuit model of electrical excita-
tion of a cardiac cell based on the Luo-Rudy phase I
model, a typical mathematical model for a cardiac cell.
The hybrid circuit model, through its hardware-imple-
mentation, allows us to perform real-time simulation of
cellular excitations as well as their propagation in a net-
work of hybrid cell models as a cardiac tissue model.
The hardware-implemented tissue model
inherits the
real-time capability of the single hybrid cell model, inde-
pendent of the size of the tissue network. To our best
knowledge,
to design and

this is the ﬁrst attempt

implement a hardware circuit model of spatially distrib-
uted cardiac tissue with biophysically detailed ion chan-
nel currents responsible for cellular excitations.

I. INTRODUCTION

current, the slow inward Ca2þ

Contraction of a cardiac myocyte is triggered by a mem-
brane action potential, which is controlled by transmembrane
currents through various types of ion channels.1,2 Major ion
þ
current, the transient
currents include the fast inward Na
þ
current, the slow
outward K
þ
delayed rectiﬁer K
current, and the slow delayed rectiﬁer
þ
outward current, among others. A cardiac action potential,
K
referred to also as excitation, is often generated in response to
a supra-threshold current stimulation. The excitability of the
cell decreases for a period of time after a prior excitation,
causing the refractoriness of the cell. The heart consists of a
huge number of such excitable cells,3 about 20 million myo-
cytes in adult rats4 and about 800 million myocytes in human
ventricles,5 connected locally by the gap junctions that allow
spatial conductions of action potentials through the heart tis-
sue. Thus, the heart is a typical large scale excitable medium
that can potentially exhibit reentry excitations such as spiral
waves of conducting excitations.6–11 Some cardiac arrhyth-
mias are perpetuated by reentrant mechanisms, in which a
local excitation conducts through a part of the heart

referred to as reentrant tachycardia.12

Methodologies that have been employed so far to theoreti-
cally understand the nonlinear dynamics of excitable media
include mathematical modelings with computer simulations as
well as electronic experiments that utilize hardware-imple-
mented nonlinear circuits, by which experimentally observed
dynamics of real-world excitable media have been reproduced
and analyzed qualitatively and=or quantitatively. The use of
mathematical models with computer simulations is favorable
because of their large capability for describing physical and=or
physiological mechanisms in detail, allowing practically one-
to-one correspondence between parameters in the models and
real physical quantities. Indeed, mathematical models of the
ventricular cardiac action potential in single cells have contin-
ued their remarkable development and improvement after the
Hodgkin-Huxley formulation13 with the gating theory of con-
ductance-based ion channel dynamics, initiated in the ﬁrst
modeling attempt by FitzHugh14 and Noble,15 continued by
Beeler and Reuter,16 Luo and Rudy,17–19 and many others
including models with Markov-type channel kinetics,2 until
today as described in Refs. 2 and 20–22. A large number of
detailed physical state variables have been introduced in recent
models in order to take new experimental observations at the
cellular, sub-cellular, and molecular levels into account.22–25
Therefore, some of the recent studies at the tissue and organ
levels try to use such detailed biophysical models to investigate
excitation conductions in heart tissue.26–31 However, tissue
models, as well as whole ventricle models, should consist of a
large number of single cell models, which causes a new prob-
lem in the amount of computations required to obtain meaning-
ful steady-state dynamics from their simulations.32,33 Due to
this drawback, it is a still challenging issue to simulate dynam-
ics of cardiac tissue models consisting of the latest detailed sin-
gle cell models as their compartmental nodes. In this respect, it
is also important to develop minimal models that can quantita-
tively reproduce the variety aspects of dynamic characteristics,
such as restitution curves, of detailed biophysical models and
use them for tissue level simulations.34,35

Hardware-implemented excitable media have their own
long history of investigation, comparable to that of the mathe-
matical models, as traced back to circuits of excitable systems
proposed in the 1960s (Refs. 36–38). In particular, Nagumo et
al.37 demonstrated that their active transmission line involving
nine active nodal compartments could simulate propagating
action potentials along a nerve axon, in which each active
node was implemented by a tunnel diode with an N-shaped
current-voltage (I-V) relationship mimicking the one in the
Bonhoeffer-van der Pol model.39 Advantages to developing
hardware-implemented excitable media include their capabil-
ity for performing real-time computations of their dynamics,
independent of the size of the system, i.e., the number of ex-
citable nodal compartments used in the systems, as well as
their potential use in medical engineering applications.
Although fewer attempts40 have been made for hardware
implementation of spatially distributed excitable media after
Nagumo et al., developments of circuit models mimicking
neuronal and cardiac cellular dynamics have been continued.
Hoshimiya et al.41 proposed an electronic circuit model of

excitable membrane realized by a single time-dependent (tran-
sient) I-V relationship determining a total membrane current
through different types of ion channels. Maeda et al.42,43 and
Sekine et al.44,45 constructed analog circuit models with two
or three ion channel currents in which I-V relationships were
activated at different time scales in order to simulate bursting
or pacemaker type neuronal excitations. These circuit models
are beneﬁcial for studying the nonlinear dynamics of excitable
media qualitatively. However, due to the qualitative design of
their I-V relationships,
to establish
explicit correspondence between the currents in a hardware
circuit model and the ion channel currents of an excitable cell
unlike in the case of the mathematical models. Only a few
studies have succeeded to design analog circuits that are bio-
physically detailed and have quantitative correspondence to a
real cell.46

is usually difﬁcult

it

One of the main issues for studying excitation conduc-
tions in the ﬁeld of cardiac physiology and pathology is
understanding how the action potential conduction and reen-
try dynamics at the tissue level are inﬂuenced by cellular
level dysfunction of speciﬁc ion channels28,47–49 that cause
abnormal cellular excitation such as in long QT syndrome.50
In order to provide comprehensive answers to this sort of
question using a mathematical or hardware circuit model of
cardiac tissue, it is required for every cellular model (com-
partmental node) used in the tissue model to include physio-
logically and quantitatively plausible models of ion channel
currents rather than simple and qualitative models.

Recently, we have proposed a hardware circuit model of
an excitable cell that can quantitatively reproduce the action
potential generation and phase-locked and chaotic responses
to periodic current pulse stimulations observed in the Luo-
Rudy phase I (LR-I) model17 for a mammalian cardiac ven-
tricular cell based on comparisons in the action potential
waveforms and bifurcation diagrams that shows parameter
regions for various phase-locked dynamics.51 Here, we ﬁrst
report a slightly modiﬁed version of the circuit model brieﬂy.
We then propose a model of a spatially distributed extension
of a one-dimensional cardiac tissue with its hardware imple-
mentation. The circuit model allows us to perform real-time
simulations of spatially conducting cardiac action potentials.
In particular, we show that the circuit tissue model can ex-
hibit real-time dynamics for initiation of the reentry induced
by uni-directional block and for phase resetting that leads to
annihilation of the reentry in response to impulsive current
stimulations at appropriate locations and timings. The dy-
namics of the hybrid model are compared to those obtained
numerically by the LR-I model in order to demonstrate that
the circuit model can be utilized for simulating large scale
cellular network in real-time as an alternative to numerical
simulations.

tively short time constant. We designed each of these ana-
log circuits by exploiting the intrinsic voltage-current
relationships of bipolar
resistors (R),
capacitors (C), and voltage sources to reproduce the steady-
state I-V relationships for IK1, IKp, and Ib, and the transient
as well as the steady-state I-V relationships for INa. An elec-
tronic circuit simulation tool (Altium Designer version 6,
Australia) was utilized to design these analog circuits. IK
and Isi were reproduced by the digital part of the hybrid cell
model using a 16-bit high-performance dsPIC30f4011
microcontroller (Microchip Technology, USA) with a proc-
essing speed of 120 MHz. To increase the speed of calcula-
tion, we accessed certain data from pre-constructed lookup
tables stored in the memory (ROM) rather than calculating
the functions in equations which represent the ion channel
currents. In particular, seven nonlinear static functions (ad,
bd, af, bf, aX, bX, and Xi) of the membrane potential Vm
were stored as tables in ROM for a range of Vm between
 100 and 120 mV with a resolution (step) of 0.5 mV. For
Vm values between the resolution step of the table, the near-
est value of the table was used as an output of each func-
tion. See supplemental material66 for details.

Figure 3 illustrates the overall circuit of the hybrid cell
model with its marginal circuits, where the core part is
depicted as two boxes denoted as the digital and analog
parts. Detailed circuit diagrams of the analog and digital
parts of the core circuit are shown separately in Figs. 4 and 5,
respectively. The circuit branches of (a), (b), (c), and (d) in

variables with six types of ion channel currents. The ion
channel currents are the fast inward sodium current INa, the
slow inward current Isi carried mainly by calcium ions, the
time-dependent potassium current IK, the time-independent
potassium current IK1, the time-independent plateau potas-
sium current IKp, and the background current Ib carried by
sodium, potassium, and calcium ions. See Fig. 1 for an
equivalent electrical circuit where Vm is the membrane
potential. The voltage source in each channel represents the
electro-chemical Nernst potential of the corresponding ion.
The six ion channel currents are summed to give the total
channel current Iion as in Eq. (1). Placing Iion in parallel to
the current through the capacitive component of the mem-
brane circuit Cm yields Eq. (2) for the total current ﬂow Im

B. Hybrid cell model

The analog-digital hybrid active circuit for a single car-
diac cell, referred to here as the hybrid cell model, includes
analog circuits and the digital circuit of a dsPIC microcon-
troller. The core part of the hybrid cell model was designed
as shown in Fig. 2. Four out of the six ion channel branches
were designed using analog circuits, and the remaining two
branches were lumped together using the single dsPIC. The
action potentials of the hybrid cell model were produced by
injecting external current stimulations, Iext, which should be
equal to Im in Eq. (2). A validation criterion for each of the
six branches in the hybrid cell model to be quantitatively
close to the corresponding ion channel in LR-I model was
set if the transient and=or steady-state nonlinear I-V rela-
tionships of the ion channel in LR-I could be reproduced
quantitatively by the circuit branch in the hybrid cell
model. The analog circuits were used to implement the
time-independent ion currents of IK1, IKp, and Ib, and the
time-dependent fast sodium current INa which has a rela-

by the dsPIC are provided as supplemental material.66

Let us illustrate how the hybrid cell model behaves by re-
ferring to Fig. 3. We start with a voltage signal at the terminal
1 of Fig. 3, which is identical with the terminal 1 of Fig. 4,
corresponding to the cardiac cell membrane potential Vm. This
Vm is fed into the port of a 10-bit analog to digital converter of
the dsPIC at terminal 3 of Fig. 3, sampled with a frequency of
2.5 kHz. IK and Isi are then computed in the dsPIC at each
instant of time for a given Vm to generate the output voltage
from the digital part at the terminal 4 of Fig. 3 through a 10-
bit digital to analog converter. This output voltage is propor-
tional to the sum of IK and Isi, determining the value of V digital
that is fed-back into the analog circuit. The amount of exter-
nally injected pulsatile stimulus current Iext is given by a com-
mand voltage pulse Vext. The voltages Vdigital, Vext, and the
membrane potential Vm are summed up to generate the poten-
tial difference between Vdigitalþ Vextþ Vm and Vm as
Vdigitalþ Vext which induces the current  IK  Isiþ Iext by
using the resistor R7. Kirchhoff’s laws applied at the T-shaped
branch at the upper part of the capacitance C1 of Fig. 3 ensure
the sum of  IK  Isiþ Iext,  INa  IK1  IKp  Ib, and
that

hybrid cell model is powered by the direct current (dc) power
supplies of 9 (Vþ) and  9 V (V ) as shown in Fig. 3. Circuit
diagrams necessary for providing the voltage sources (V1 to
V9) in the analog part of Fig. 4 and a power circuit for generat-
ing VCC (5 V) in the digital part of Fig. 5 are shown in the Ap-
pendix. Details of all electronic components used to construct

The time scale of the analog-digital hybrid cell model
was set to be the same as that of LR-I model. The current
and voltage scales of the analog-digital hybrid cell model
(milli-ampere and volt) were not the same as those of the
LR-I model (micro-ampere and milli-volt). The scale conver-
sions of the voltage and the current were performed because

in LR-I model were too small and difﬁcult to handle on the
scale of the analog circuits. In particular, we converted the
scales as follows: 8 lA of LR-I to 3 mA of the hybrid cell
model,  100 mV of LR-I to 0 V of the hybrid and 120 mV
of LR-I to 5 V of the hybrid cell model. In formulae, the
scale conversions of
the voltage and the current are
expressed as follows:

tional ampliﬁers) and the I-V relationship of INa as dis-

Propagation of action potentials in an excitable tissue is
often modeled by a continuous excitable medium, leading to
a model described by a reaction-diffusion equation. In partic-

The action potential waveform for the single cell pro-

to compare with that produced by the hybrid cell model
shown in Fig. 6(b) with the original voltage=current
scales and in Fig. 6(c) with the converted scales. An im-
pulsive stimulation with a duration of 1 ms and an in-
tensity of 80 lA was applied to LR-I and also to the
hybrid cell model, showing that
the action potential
waveform produced by the hybrid cell model was quan-
titatively the same as that by LR-I model. In particular,

for each of all LR-I and hybrid cell compartment models
were doubled so that the time constant functions sd(Vm)
and sf(Vm) were halved, resulting in a shorter APD in every
single compartment. The modiﬁcation could be performed
easily for the hybrid cell models because the dynamics of
Isi were implemented in each dsPIC used for each hybrid
cell model. Although physiological situations correspond-

it was not a problem for our purpose to
examine whether the hybrid model could reproduce the

nism of anatomical reentrant cardiac arrhythmia. Here, a
ring of length L ¼ 4.7 cm is considered. Practically, this
length was selected due to the number of hybrid cells avail-
able, and it might not be long enough for supporting a reen-
try excitation on the ring. This is because the typical
conduction velocity of an action potential is about 60 cm=s
in cardiac tissue,53 resulting in a period of reentry about 78
ms for the ring. This reentry period is much smaller than a
usual APD (about 150–200 ms) during conduction. In order
to enable the ring to support a reentrant action potential, it
was necessary to modify the dynamics of every single
hybrid cell compartment so that the APD became smaller
than usual. To this end, we modiﬁed the time scale of the
Isi current dynamics of each cell for both LR-I and hybrid
models. That is, the rate functions ad(Vm), bd(Vm), af(Vm),

tively. Note that (i  1) refers to N for i¼ 1 and (iþ 1) refers
to 1 for i¼ N, because of the ring geometry of the model.
That is, the 1st and the Nth compartments are connected by
the gap junction of resistivity Rd. The non-ring shaped cable
that has two open ends (referred to as the open-end cable) can
also be established by disconnecting the 1st and the Nth com-
partments, and it was used just for a comparison with the ring
cable. This set of ordinary differential equations together with
channel gating dynamics of every compartment for the LR-I
were integrated numerically using the explicit Euler method
with time step Dt¼ 0.001 ms. With these parameters, the lin-
ear stability criterion (Dx)2=Dt > 4D is satisﬁed.

Although we tried to have quantitative reproduction of
this LR-I cable model as much as possible using a ring-topol-
ogy-network of 80 hybrid cell compartment models, it was
required to modify the value of the gap junction resistance to
Rd¼ 2.35 kXcm2, by which the conduction velocity of the
action potential along the hybrid cable model became almost
the same as that of the LR-I cable model as shown below.

isolated cell models as in the third largest APD of Fig. 7,
where APD of the non-conducting action potential was about
150 ms for the single isolated hybrid cell model and about
100 ms for the single isolated LR-I. Differences in APD
between the hybrid cell model and LR-I was due to a vari-
ability of analog devices and the I-V relationship of INa (see
discussion in Sec. V). Action potential conduction on the
ring cable with the modiﬁed Isi dynamics reduced APD fur-
thermore. In this case, APDs in the hybrid model and the
LR-I model were about 100 ms and 80 ms, respectively, for
non-reentrant conducting action potentials that were evoked
by a sequence of long-time-separated current pulses applied
at one point of the ring. The conduction velocity in this non-
reentrant conduction was also about 35 cm=s for the hybrid
ring cable and about 31 cm=s for the LR-I ring cable. APD
was the shortest for the reentrant action potential with the
modiﬁed Isi dynamics both in the hybrid ring and LR-I ring
cables. It was about 70 ms in the hybrid ring cable and about
60 ms in the LR-I ring cable. The conduction velocity of the
reentry was about 32 cm=s for the hybrid ring cable and
about 28 cm=s for the LR-I ring cable. The reentrant conduc-
tion velocities obtained in the ring geometry were slower
than those in the cable because the ring was effectively paced
more rapidly, thereby invoking conduction velocity restitu-
tion. These conduction velocities during reentry are slower
than the physiological conduction velocity,53 but they are
comparable to those obtained by some of previous studies.54
In summary, the hybrid and the LR-I cables showed quantita-
tively similar characteristics in APD and conduction velocity
for both with original and modiﬁed Isi dynamics, although
we should discuss detailed differences between Figs. 7(a)
and 7(b).

For the circus movement reentry to occur in the ring-
shaped LR-I and the hybrid cable models with the modiﬁed
Isi dynamics, an unidirectional block of conducting action
potentials and the presence of an excitable gap are required
where the excitable gap is deﬁned as a spatial interval of the
medium with enough excitability on the ring. Here, the uni-
directional block was induced by using the so called S1-S2
protocol,12,54 in which single or several (usually equally time
spaced)
impulsive stimulations referred to as S1 were
applied at a given location on the ring, and then another im-
pulsive stimulation referred to as S2 was applied at a differ-
ent location from the S1 site.

Panels (a) and (b) in Fig. 8 show space-time diagrams
showing changes in the membrane potential as a function of
time and position along the ring during initiation of reentry in
the hybrid and LR-I cable models, respectively. See MPG
video supplemental material66 demonstrating the reentry dy-
namics observed in the hybrid circuit model. Quantitative
reproduction of LR-I cable dynamics by the hybrid cable
model can be conﬁrmed. We used impulsive stimulations for
S1 and S2 with a duration of 1 ms and an intensity of 150 lA.
In each ﬁgure, two S1 stimulations are applied to the ring at
the compartment of number i¼ 1 (the bottom of the spatial
axis in the panels), pacing the excitation of the medium. Each
stimulus evokes excitation at the stimulated site, generating
two conducting action potentials. One propagates clockwise
and the other counter-clockwise along the ring. As is common

models embedded in the open-end as well as the ring cables.
In particular, it was examined how the APD was altered by
the modiﬁcation of the Isi dynamics and by the excitation
conduction through the gap junction connection in the hybrid
cell and the hybrid cable models as well as in the single LR-I
and the LR-I cable models. In both Fig. 7(a) for the hybrid
models and Fig. 7(b) for the LR-I models, the action poten-
tial with the largest APD of about 350 ms is from the single
Isi dynamics in
isolated cell models with the original
response to a single current pulse stimulation applied to the
cell model at the resting potential. The second largest APD
of about 300 ms in each of the hybrid and LR-I models is
from the conducting action potential along the open-end
cable also in response to a sequence of current stimulations
separated by a long time interval (1000 ms). The stimulations
were applied at one end of the cable, and the action potential
was recorded at the middle point of the cable during steady
state dynamics of the periodically stimulated cable. The con-
duction velocity was about 35 cm=s for the open-end hybrid
cable and about 31 cm=s for the open-end LR-I cable.
The modiﬁcation of Isi dynamics reduced APD in the single

hybrid ring cable model. (b) LR-I ring
cable model. In both models, Isi dynam-
ics were modiﬁed to reduce APD so that
the small ring could support the reentry.
Arrow heads represent two S1 and single
S2 stimulations. For the hybrid cable
model,
the membrane potentials were
recorded only for the compartments 1, 4,
8, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 28, 32, 36,
40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, and
80, using a 24 ch recording device with
analog-to-digital converters.

in excitable media, each conducting action potential possesses
a wave-front and a tail. The wave-front progressively excites
the compartments ahead of the wave-front, and the wave-tail
is accompanied with refractoriness that decreases as it
becomes distant from the action potential. These two conduct-
ing action potentials eventually collide with each other at the
opposite side of the stimulated site, leading to annihilation of
the action potentials due to the refractoriness located at each
of the wave-tails. The S2, corresponding to an ectopic focus
excitation in the real heart, is then applied at a position (the
compartment number i¼ 18) slightly away from the S1 site at
an appropriate time interval after the second application of S1.
In order to initiate the reentrant wave, the S2 must be applied
when the action potential generated by the S1 has passed
through the S2 site and refractoriness of the wave-tail is still
large in the one side of the S2 site (near side of the leaving
action potential, referred to here as refractory side) but the
excitability has regained on the other side referred to here as
excitable side. The S2 with this speciﬁc timing generates an
action potential that can propagate only to the excitable side
(unidirectional block). Since the action potentials generated
by the S1 are annihilated eventually, the single action poten-
tial generated by the S2 alone remains, initiating the circus
movement reentrant wave.
The cycle length of the reentry in its steady state was
TLR ¼ 165 ms for the LR-I cable and that for the hybrid
cable model was Thyb ¼ 149:3 6 1:6 ms (mean 6 SD). The
variability of the cycle length was only for the hybrid cable,
and it was due to the random nature of the real circuit. As
shown in Figs. 7 and 8, APD after the initiation of reentry
was about 70 ms which was shorter than those generated in
response to S1 stimulations in both the LR-I and hybrid cable
models. This is because the wave-front of the reentrant wave
is always chasing the wave-tail, and thus excitability of the
ring cable cannot be fully recovered.

For delivering S1 and S2 stimulations to the hybrid
cable model, we constructed an impulsive stimulator by
using an H8=3694F microcontroller to control the timings of
the stimulations systematically. See Appendix for details of

the circuit. Moreover, details of the electronic components
and the source program written into the H8 microcontroller
are described in the supplemental material.66

IV. RESETTING AND ANNIHILATION OF REENTRY IN
ACTIVE CABLE MODELS

Glass and his colleagues as well as other groups have
been establishing a theory to handle this issue based on the
phase resetting of nonlinear oscillators.55–62 Here, we utilize
their theory for the LR-I and the hybrid ring cable models
with modiﬁed Isi dynamics to show that the latter behaves
satisfactorily as the former.

In the numerical and hardware experiments below, single
and=or ﬁnite sequences of impulsive current stimulations
were delivered to the ring cable models that support the reen-
try excitation as shown in the previous section. Those stimula-
tions with the same stimulus intensity as in the unidirectional
block experiment were applied again at the compartment of
the number i¼ 18.

Panels (1a)-(1c) and (2a)-(2c) in Fig. 9 show space-time
diagrams exemplifying the responses of the reentrant excita-
tion to single stimulations as a function of time and position in
the hybrid and LR-I ring cable models, respectively. One
could observe a good coincidence between the dynamics of
the hybrid and the LR-I ring cable models. In both Figs. 9(1a)
and 9(2a), the stimulation was applied at the fully refractory
side of the wave-tail of the reentry. Thus the stimulus failed to
generate any propagating action potentials, less affecting the
original reentry. In both Figs. 9(1b) and 9(2b), the stimulus
was applied at a slightly later time instant than (1a) and (2a),
generating a single action potential propagating only in a
clockwise direction to collide with the originally counter-
clockwise propagating action potential, leading to the annihi-
lation of the reentry. This result suggests that a single
stimulation delivered at an appropriate time interval referred
to here as the annihilation interval, at which the wave-tail of
the original reentry is located slightly away from the stimula-
tion site, could annihilate the reentry. See MPG video

reentry observed in the hybrid circuit model.
In both
Figs. 9(1c) and 9(2c), the stimulus was applied at the excitable
gap located far behind the wave-tail of the original reentry,
inducing two propagating action potentials in both clockwise
and counterclockwise directions. The wave propagating in the
clockwise direction collided with the original reentrant wave,
and they were annihilated with each other. The wave traveling
in the counterclockwise direction persisted, leading to the
resetting of the reentrant circulation rhythm, where the succes-
sive occurrence times of excitation at every compartment

were advanced about 50 ms in comparison with the expected
times for the original reentry excitation. These three cases are
typical responses of the reentry.

The resetting (advance and delay of the circulation
rhythm of the reentrant wave) and the annihilation of the
reentry can be analyzed using the phase resetting curve
(PRC) as performed in the previous studies55,56 in both
hybrid and LR-I ring cable models. To this end, the phase of
the reentrant wave is deﬁned based on the time instant when
the reentrant action potential is detected at a given recording
site. Here, we located a recording site the same as the

stimulation site, i.e., the compartment number i¼ 18. First,
the stimulation phase / that takes a value between 0 and 1 is
deﬁned as

/ ¼ tstim
T

;

(8)

where T is the period of the steady state reentry with no stimu-
lations, and tstim is the time elapsed from the time instant
when the last propagating reentrant action potential is detected
at the recording site before the stimulation is applied. A small
stimulation phase roughly between 0 < / < 0.45, correspond-
ing to roughly 0 < tstim < 75 ms, implies that the stimulation is
applied when the stimulation site is in the middle of the reen-
trant action potential. A stimulation phase close to 1, corre-
sponding to tstim  T, implies that the stimulation is applied
close to an oncoming wave-front of the reentry excitation.

The amount of phase reset D/ in response to a stimula-

tion with its phase / is deﬁned as

D/ ¼ DT
T

;

(9)

where DT is the difference between the expected time instant
of detecting the original reentrant action potential (when no
stimulation is applied) and the time instant of detecting the
reentrant action potential that is affected or newly generated
by the stimulation. Positive and negative DT corresponds to
phase delay and advance, respectively.

The result of detailed examinations on the responses
of the reentry to stimulations delivered at various phases
can be summarized using PRC. Figure 10 shows the PRC
of the hybrid cable model (a) and that of the LR-I cable
model. In both cases, the phase resetting was largely nega-
tive (advanced) when the stimulation phase is in the latter
half of the reentry cycle. Only small amount of the phase
resetting could be found for the stimulation phase between
0.1 and 0.45. When a stimulation is applied around the
middle of the cycle length, roughly 0.47 < / < 0.56 for
the hybrid cable model and roughly 0.42 < / < 0.51 for
the LR-I cable model as depicted by vertical gray bands
in Figs. 10(a) and 10(b), the reentry is annihilated by the
stimulation as shown in Figs. 9(1b) and 9(2b). The phase
interval corresponding to this gray band is referred to as
the annihilation phase interval. Note that the PRC of the
hybrid ring cable model in Fig. 10(a) was obtained by
averaging three PRCs because the amount of resetting for
a given stimulation phase could vary for every trial, possi-
bly due to internal noises contaminated in the hardware
circuits and small differences in the parameter values of
every analog device. Moreover,
the hybrid cable
model, the amount of phase reset at /¼ 1 was not exactly
the same as that at /¼ 0. The difference was about 7 ms,
and it was also due to the random ﬂuctuation of the reen-
try period in the hybrid cable. Aside from this random na-
ture in the hybrid model,
the similarity between Figs.
10(a) and 10(b) is satisfactory.

lation phases, we should be able to predict the dynamics of
the reentry in response to a periodic sequence of the stimu-
lations as examined in the previous study.56 Let us consider
the response of the reentry to a sequence of the stimula-
tions with period Tstim. According to the theory of PRC, for
a given phase of the ﬁrst stimulation /1, the second stimu-
the phase /2 ¼ /1   D/1 þ Tstim= T
lation is applied at
(mod 1). In general, for a given nth stimulation phase, the
(n þ 1)th stimulation phase can be described as follows:

/nþ1 ¼ /n   D/n þ Tstim
T

;ðmod 1Þ:

(10)

Using this iterative mapping formulation, we can obtain a
sequence of stimulation phases f/ng for a given initial stim-
ulation phase /1. If /n falls within the annihilation phase
interval for the ﬁrst time along the sequence, we can predict
that the reentry is annihilated by the nth stimulation of the
periodic train of the stimulations with period Tstim.

We examined whether this theory could predict the reen-
try dynamics in the hybrid cable model and the LR-I cable
model. For each of these two cable models, we used the PRC
obtained in Fig. 10 to establish the iterative mapping as in Eq.
(10). As an example, we set Tstim¼ 185 ms and /1¼ 0.6875
for the hybrid cable model. Equation (10) with the PRC
shown in Fig. 10(a) predicts that the ﬁrst stimulation induces a
relatively large delay D/1 0.38, followed by /2¼ /1
 D/1þ 1.25 (mod 1)¼ 0.3193, and /3 ¼/2   D/2þ 1.25
(mod 1)¼ 0.5693 which is within the annihilation interval.
Figure 11 shows the dynamics of the hybrid ring cable model
in response to this set of stimulations. The results conﬁrm the
prediction of the theory. That is, two stimulations separated
by Tstim¼ 185 ms could not annihilate the reentry as in Fig.
11(1a), but three did as in Fig. 11(1b).
Another example performed for the LR-I ring cable
used the stimulations with Tstim¼ 200 and /1¼ 0.8182. As
in the hybrid cable model, Eq. (10) with the PRC of Fig.
10(b) for the LR-I cable predicts that /3¼ 0.4732 falls
within the annihilation phase interval, and Figs. 11(2a) and
11(2b) conﬁrmed this prediction. Quantitative similarity
between Figs. 11(1a), 11(1b) and 11(2a), 11(2b) was satis-
factory again, conﬁrming a capability of reproducing the
LR-I cable dynamics by the hybrid cable model. However,
the similarity was not so much enough as we could predict
LR-I dynamics using the PRC obtained from the phase reset-
ting experiments in the hybrid cable model.

V. DISCUSSION

In this article, we showed that the proposed analog-digi-
tal hybrid circuit models of a single cell (hybrid cell model)
and spatially distributed cable (hybrid cable model) were ca-
pable of reproducing action potential generation as well as
the conduction of action potentials in the LR-I models of a
cardiac ventricular cell and its one-dimensional cable. Good
correspondence between the hybrid cable model and LR-I
cable model was demonstrated using a one dimensional
active cable as a model of anatomical reentry in a cardiac tis-
sue with various conditions. Those include (1) unidirectional
block to initiate reentry, (2) phase resetting by single impul-
sive stimulations, (3) annihilation of the reentry by appropri-
ately timed single
can
characterize the reentry dynamics in response to single stim-
ulations at various timings, and (5) sequential phase reset-
tings that leads to annihilation of the reentry as predicted by
the one dimensional discrete Poincare´ mappings.

Overall correspondence between the hybrid model and
LR-I model was satisfactory. However, if we looked care-
fully at the action potential waveform in the single isolated
hybrid cell model, it was different from one in the LR-I
model for the interval right after the phase 0 upstroke as in
Fig. 6. In particular, the initial phase 1 repolarization in the
hybrid model was more pronounced. This was due to poor
reproduction in the fast sodium current INa by the analog cir-
cuit. This is because INa is time-dependent with the time-
dependent transient I-V relationship. As shown in the supple-
mental material,66 the inward current response of the analog
INa to the voltage clamp was smaller in amplitude and slower

in decay for most of the clamp voltages. As a possible han-
dling, we tried to equalize net amount of the current inﬂow
as much as possible. The small amplitude INa inﬂux caused
the pronounced repolarization at the phase 1. The poor repro-
duction of INa also induced the difference in the action poten-
tial waveform between the hybrid and LR-I models when we
modiﬁed Isi dynamics as shown in Fig. 7, in which APD of
the hybrid cell model was about 1.5 times longer than that of
the LR-I model. This might be due to the slow decay of INa
at the voltage around 0 mV. That is, the long lasting INa held
back the repolarization even when Isi was decreased by the
modiﬁcation. A better reproduction of the transient I-V rela-
tionship for INa with other combinations of analog devices
can improve agreement between the hybrid model and the
LR-I model. Although we have tried to implement INa in the
dsPIC, there was insufﬁcient memory space in the dsPIC.

The hybrid cable model was able to perform real-time
simulations of excitation propagation in cardiac tissues. It
should be noted that, since each of single hybrid cell models
always operates real-time and interact with neighboring
hybrid cell models just through analog resistors, the real-time
capability of the tissue circuit is completely independent of
the number of the cell models and even topology of the con-
nections between the cell models. In this study, we used a PC
with Intel(R) Core(TM) 2 Quad CPU Q9550 2.83 GHz and
3.25 GB RAM. For the numerical simulation of LR-I cable
with 80 compartments, it took about 20 s for 200 ms simula-
tion time span that was roughly equal to one cycle length of
the reentry. Of course it took just 200 ms for simulating 200
ms in the hybrid cable model. This is the meaning of the real-
time capability in this study. That is, the hybrid model can
interact electrically with real world cardiac cells if necessary.
Although no optimization algorithms were introduced into the
C or Cþþ source code program used for simulating the LR-I
cable dynamics, the hybrid cable model was able to realize
simulations over 100 times faster than those required for the
numerical simulations of the LR-I cable model. Sophisticated
techniques as well as HPC technology can speed the numeri-
cal simulation so that the speed ratio could be smaller than
100 obtained in this study. However, it will take a long time
for numerical simulations of large scale cardiac tissues to
catch up with real-time performance.

From the satisfactory correspondences that we examined
here between the hybrid and LR-I cable models, and taking
into account the real-time simulation capability of the hybrid
model, we could conclude that the hybrid model might be a
useful tool for large scale simulations of cardiac tissue dy-
namics, as an alternative to numerical simulations, leading
toward further understanding of the reentrant mechanisms.

How can a cardiac tissue model with the hybrid cell mod-
els be large scale? Each analog-digital hybrid cell model used
in this study was powered with 69 V, and the peak total cur-
rent measured at the dc power sources Vþ and V  of Fig. 3
for the analog part of the model was 0.08 A and  0.06 A,
respectively. For the digital part with 5 V dc power source
(VCC) of Fig. 5, it was 0.14 A. Simple calculations give us a
rough estimation of the energy consumption in a single hybrid
cell model, and it is about 2 W at most. For the hybrid cable
model with N cell models, this becomes 2N W. The energy

consumption of the hybrid cable model with N¼ 80 is thus
about 160 W, which is roughly comparable order with an
energy consumption single desktop PC. This estimation
implies that a large quantity of energy might be consumed for
large scale real-time dynamics simulations. As the mission of
the current study was to perform real-time simulations of exci-
tation propagation, we were not concerned with the issue of
minimizing the power consumption in the circuits. One way
to achieve reduction in the energy consumption, and also
reduction in the physical size of the circuit, is to implement
this analog-digital hybrid circuit using LSI
technology.
Indeed, development of technology begins to allow for such
realizations as attempted in some recent studies.63,64 There-
fore, if the proposed hybrid cell model can be implemented as
a LSI circuit in the future, dynamics of a large scale aggrega-
tion of the hybrid cell models as a cardiac tissue model can be
simulated in real-time with a smaller energy consumption,
where we would be able to address more complex dynamics
of the heart tissue as a large scale excitable medium than the
one exhibited by one dimensional tissue and control of them,

such as spiral wave propagations, break-up of spiral waves,
and deﬁbrillation of them.10,28,35,47,65

APPENDIX: GLOSSARY OF CIRCUIT DIAGRAMS

Figure 12 shows nine circuit diagrams of the voltage
sources (V1-V9) for generating the Nernst potentials and
others of ion channel currents in the analog part shown in
Fig. 4. Basically, general-purpose 6 V regulators (7806) are
used to ﬁx the voltage signal of Vþ to 6 V and capacitors are
applied for smoothing the electrical signal. In some of the
circuits, the voltage signal of 6 V is divided by voltage-

dividing circuits which consist of resistors as shown in the
ﬁgure. Then, voltage followers which are constructed by
using a general-purpose operational ampliﬁer, LF356N, are
applied to reinforce the current signal with the value of V1,
V2, V3,V4, V5, V6, V7, V8, and V9 as 1.3 V, 1.2 V, 6 V,
1.52 V, 2.3 V, 6 V, 1 V, 3 V, and 3.6 V, respectively.

Figure 13 shows the regulated þ5 V (VCC) dc power sup-
ply with 1 A current limiter for the dsPIC and the H8=3694F
microcontroller. The base of this design is a general-purpose 5
V regulator (7805, REG.10) to maintain a constant voltage
level at 5V and the capacitors for over-voltage protection and
smoothing the electrical signal. The LED4 lights up whenever
the power source is switched on. In this study, we used 9 V
(Vþ) and  9 V (V ) supplied by a stabilized power source
device.

Figure 14 shows the circuit of the impulsive stimulator
for delivering current stimulations that induce and annihilate
reentrant excitations. This circuit was powered by the same
source that was used for the digital part of the hybrid cell
model.
