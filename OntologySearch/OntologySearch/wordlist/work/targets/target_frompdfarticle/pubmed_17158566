ABSTRACT The L-type Ca21
channel (CaV1.2) plays an important role in action potential (AP) generation, morphology, and
duration (APD) and is the primary source of triggering Ca21
-release in cardiac myocytes. In
this article we present: 1), a detailed kinetic model of CaV1.2, which is incorporated into a model of the ventricular mycoyte where it
interacts with a kinetic model of the ryanodine receptor in a restricted subcellular space; 2), evaluation of the contribution of voltage-
dependent inactivation (VDI) and Ca21
-dependent inactivation (CDI) to total inactivation of CaV1.2; and 3), description of dynamic
CaV1.2 and ryanodine receptor channel-state occupancy during the AP. Results are: 1), the CaV1.2 model reproduces experi-
]i, and the Ca21
mental single-channel and macroscopic-current data; 2), the model reproduces rate dependence of APD, [Na
-
transient (CaT), and restitution of APD and CaT during premature stimuli; 3), CDI of CaV1.2 is sensitive to Ca21
that enters the
subspace through the channel and from SR release. The relative contributions of these Ca21
sources to total CDI during the AP
vary with time after depolarization, switching from early SR dominance to late CaV1.2 dominance. 4), The relative contribution of
CDI to total inactivation of CaV1.2 is greater at negative potentials, when VDI is weak; and 5), loss of VDI due to the CaV1.2 mutation
G406R (linked to the Timothy syndrome) results in APD prolongation and increased CaT.

INTRODUCTION

Most cellular action potential (AP) models compute the
membrane potential starting from macroscopic transmem-
brane ionic currents through large ensembles of ion channels.
The ionic currents are computed using the Hodgkin-Huxley
(H-H) scheme (1), which represents voltage and time-dependent
conductance changes in terms of ‘‘gating variables’’ (e.g.,
activation, inactivation) that are independent of each other.
Current understanding of ion-channel gating clearly indi-
cates strong coupling between kinetic gating transitions that
cannot be reproduced within the H-H paradigm (2). Also, the
H-H formalism does not represent kinetic states of the ion chan-
nel (such as open, closed, inactivated) and is therefore not
suitable for simulating molecular interactions, ion-channel
mutations that alter speciﬁc kinetic transitions, or effects of
drugs that bind to the channel in a speciﬁc conformational
state. To overcome these limitations we have developed and
introduced into a model of the whole-cell, single-channel
based Markov models of cardiac INa (3,4), IKr (5,6), and IKs
(6), channels that are major determinants of the ventricular
AP. Markov models represent discrete ion-channel states and
their interactions; this property allowed us to examine kinetic
state transitions of these channels during the AP (2), simulate
the cellular arrhythmogenic manifestations of ion-channel
mutations (2–5), and study the role of molecular subunit
interactions in channel function (2,6). Recently, we used
Markov models to study the cellular electrophysiological

state) in wild-type and mutant cardiac Na
Given the important role of Cav1.2, the L-type Ca21
channel,
in AP generation, rate-dependence (8,9), and conduction
(10,11), and its participation in cellular calcium cycling and
excitation-contraction (EC) coupling (12), it is important to
develop a detailed kinetic model of this channel. Such model
could be used to study various aspects of channel gating in
the complex interactive cell environment, to predict the ef-
fects on the whole-cell AP of state-speciﬁc drug binding to
the channel, and to simulate the cellular electrophysiological
consequences of Cav1.2 mutations, such as a recently de-
scribed missense mutation G406R that causes Timothy syn-
drome and is characterized by QT interval prolongation on the
electrocardiogram and arrhythmia development, as well as an
array of other organ dysfunction (13,14).

Cav1.2 gating is both voltage and Ca21

dependent; the
time course and magnitude of [Ca21
] near the channel is a
major determinant of its inactivation kinetics. In ventricular
myocytes, Cav1.2 interacts with ryanodine receptors (RyR)
to trigger Ca21
release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)
through the calcium-induced-calcium-release (CICR) pro-
cess. The interaction occurs in a restricted subcellular space
in triad formations (15,16). Modeling the Cav1.2 channel
kinetics requires representation of the dynamic Ca21
changes
in a restricted subspace for calcium. We introduce a sub-
cellular restricted space where Cav1.2 and RyR interact
to generate a Ca21
-transient. Because our interest is in the
L-type Ca21
current, its properties, and its role in the cellular
AP and arrhythmia, we adopt a global cellular approach in
the simulations; that is, the model subcellular space represents
a subsarcolemmal space, along the length of the t-tubules,

into which both L-type Ca21
channels and RyR open.
Clearly, this approach cannot be used to simulate local micro-
scopic (molecular) processes of EC-coupling such as Ca21
spark formation, as done by others (17,18). However, as
shown in the Results section, the model recreates the relevant
global properties of calcium cycling that inﬂuence the L-type
Ca21
current, ICa(L). This global approach results in major
reduction of computing time, making the simulations of
steady-state pacing protocols that are necessary for studying
cell electrophysiology possible and practical.

Using this model, the following phenomena are studied: 1),
kinetic state transitions of Cav1.2 and RyR during the AP at
slow and fast rates; 2), the relative contributions of Ca21
-
dependent and voltage-dependent inactivation to total inacti-
vation of ICa(L); 3), sensitivity of Ca21
-dependent inactivation
to Ca21
entry through the channel and from SR release; 4),
rate dependence of AP duration (APD adaptation) and APD
]i and of the Ca21
-
restitution; 5), rate dependence of [Na
transient; restitution of the Ca21
-transient during premature
stimuli; 6), ICa(L) and AP modiﬁcation by the Cav1.2 missense
mutation G406R that has been associated with the Timothy
syndrome and its arrhythmic manifestations.

channel Markov model

L-type Ca21
A Markov representation of the L-type Ca21
channel (Fig. 1) was developed
and incorporated into a ventricular cell model. L-type Ca21
channels are
known to inactivate due to an increase in membrane potential or an increase
in intracellular Ca21
. The former, known as voltage-dependent inactivation
(VDI), is accompanied by a gating current whereas the latter, known as
Ca21
-dependent inactivation (CDI), is not. This discovery by Hadley and
Lederer (19) suggests that the mechanisms by which these inactivation
processes occur are separate, implying that channels that have inactivated
due to voltage can still be inactivated by Ca21
and vice versa. This is further
supported by experiments where VDI or CDI are altered or eliminated by
point mutations to the CaV1.2 gene. This is perhaps best illustrated by the
CaV1.2 mutation G406R, which is the underlying cause of the Timothy
syndrome, which almost completely eliminates VDI while leaving CDI
unaffected (13,14). VDI of CaV1.2 is also affected by mutations to the pore-
encoding portion of the channel (20) or mutations within the I-II linker
(13,21). CDI, which involves Ca21
binding to calmodulin (CaM) that is
constitutively tethered to a region of the CaV1.2 C-terminus known as the IQ
motif, is eliminated by mutations to either the IQ motif (22–24) or to CaM
(25). There has been recent evidence that VDI may also be dependent on the
IQ-CaM complex (26), giving rise to the possibility that VDI and CDI are
not entirely independent. We model the channel with two distinct kinetic
modes (27,28): a voltage-gating mode (ModeV) with a single conducting
state, and a mode where the channel is inactivated via a Ca21
-dependent
process (ModeCa). We selected the minimum number of channel states nec-
essary to reﬂect structural properties of the channel (four voltage sensitive
transitions before channel opening reﬂecting movement of four voltage
sensors, one for each of the four homologous domains making up the
a1 subunit of CaV1.2) and to describe the complex channel behavior (fast
and slow voltage-dependent inactivation states, IVf and IVs, (29)). The two-
tier structure (upper tier, ModeV; lower tier, ModeCa) implies that the

channel can be inactivated by Ca21
at any time, independent of the channel
being closed, open, or inactivated by voltage. In addition, this means that
channels can be simultaneously inactivated via both voltage-dependent and
Ca21
-dependent mechanisms. Despite the relatively large number of chan-
nel states, the total number of transition rates that must be computed each
time step is small (rates computed for state transitions within ModeV are the
same for ModeCa and transition rates between ModeV and ModeCa are the
same from any state).

Experimental protocols to study L-type Ca21

channels often utilize
charge carriers other than Ca21
to separate voltage-dependent inactivation
from Ca21
-dependent inactivation. To reproduce these experimental pro-
tocols with the model, we eliminate Ca21
-dependent inactivation by setting
the transition rates from ModeV to ModeCa to zero. Simulations where this
is done are noted in the text and in the ﬁgure caption.

The L-type Ca21

channel Markov model was validated utilizing a wide
range of experimental data. Our guide was to select experimental data that
were recorded in guinea pig ventricular myocytes at 37°C. In addition, we
preferentially selected experimental data that were recorded in the absence of
b-agonists as these have a signiﬁcant effect on current magnitude, voltage-
dependent properties, and Ca21

-dependent properties of the channel.

The L-type Markov model (Fig. 1) includes four closed states (C0, C1, C2,
and C3), a single open state (O), two states representing channels that have
undergone fast or slow voltage-dependent inactivation (IVf and IVs), ﬁve
states representing channels that have undergone Ca21
-dependent inactiva-
tion (C0Ca, C1Ca, C2Ca, C3Ca, and ICa), and two states that represent inac-
tivation via both voltage and Ca21
-dependent mechanisms (IVfCa and IVsCa).
The transition rates in each loop of the model (e.g., C3-O-IVs) obey micro-
scopic reversibility.

Cell model

The theoretical LRd model of a mammalian ventricular AP (30–32) (Fig. 2 A)
provides the basis for the simulations of cellular behavior in this study. The
model is based mostly on guinea pig ventricular myocyte experimental data; it
includes membrane ionic channel currents, pumps, and exchangers. The model
also accounts for processes that regulate intracellular concentration changes of
. Intracellular Ca21
, and Ca21
cycling processes represented in the
Na
model include Ca21
uptake and release by the SR and its buffering. Buffers
include calmodulin and troponin (in the myoplasm), sarcolemmal and SR
Ca21

binding sites (in the subspace), and calsequestrin (in the SR).

Subspace compartment

entry via L-type Ca21

Electron microscopic views of myocytes reveal invaginations in the cell
membrane, known as transverse or t-tubules, that increase the total surface area
of the myocyte and provide a pathway by which extracellular Ca21
can be
readily available for entry upon cell depolarization. The junctional sarcoplas-
mic reticular membrane makes close contact with sarcolemmal membrane all
along the t-tubules, the distance between the two membranes being very small
(15–20 nm). The conﬁned volume between the two membranes is commonly
referred to as the restricted space or the subsarcolemmal space. It is known that
Ca21
channels is the signal for the opening of RyRs
and Ca21
release from the SR. Immunogold-labeling techniques (33,34) have
shown that L-type Ca21
channels cluster in t-tubules and the areas of the
plasma membrane that overlie the SR membrane, supporting their important
role in the CICR process. Ca21
entry into the restricted space via L-type
channels (followed closely by Ca21
Ca21
release from the SR) generates
Ca21
concentrations near the inner membrane surface that are much greater
than those observed in the bulk myoplasm. The magnitude of these con-
centrations and the rate at which the concentrations return to basal levels is
dependent upon several factors including: 1), subspace volume; 2), Ca21
diffusion rates from the subspace to the bulk myoplasmic volume; 3), the
presence of buffers within the subspace; 4), the rate of Ca21
entry into the
subspace (i.e., via L-type and RyR channels); and 5), the rate of Ca21

a single compartment comprising 2% of the total volume of the myocyte
into which both L-type Ca21
channels and RyR open (see Appendix for

exchange protein (35,36) has shown that these proteins are present with
exchanger
greater density within the t-tubules, hence 20% of the Na
is included in the modeled subspace (37). Finally, we include sarcolemmal
and SR membrane binding sites that buffer calcium (38).

Ryanodine receptor Markov model

A Markov model of the RyR, modiﬁed from that originally presented by Fill
et al. (39) is utilized in the simulations (Fig. 2 B). The RyR Markov model
is based upon experiments by Zahradnikova´ et al. (40) where individual
RyR channels were fused into a planar lipid bilayer. This preparation allows
for direct control of Ca21
concentrations to determine rates of channel ac-
tivation and inactivation (an approach that shows that RyR channels both
activate and inactivate due to a rise in subspace calcium ([Ca21
]ss). In ad-
dition, the four transitions necessary to reach the open state reﬂect the
homotetrameric structure of RyR (41). All of the channel transition rates are
increased to adjust for the temperature differences between the experiments
(23°C) and model (37°C). An addition to the original Fill (39) model is the
inclusion of four additional inactivation states (I1–I4) connected to the closed

demonstrated that introduction of CASQ2 to the SR increased the RyR open
probability and Hidalgo and Donoso (45) showed that interventions that led
to conformational change of CASQ2 resulted in opening of RyRs. Studies
by Gyo¨rke et al. (46) showed that low SR Ca21
led to CASQ2 inhibition of
RyR opening and that upon elevation of SR Ca21
this inhibition decreased.
Communication between CASQ2 and RyR may be mediated by the auxil-
iary proteins triadin and junctin (47,48). Because RyR channels in the exper-
iments of Zahradnikova´ et al. (40) were studied in isolation, their dependence
on CASQ2 was not apparent and hence not incorporated into their Markov
model of RyR. We incorporate this dependence into the RyR Markov model
presented here.

states (C1–C4). This change allowed RyR channels to deactivate without
having to pass through the open state, preventing reopening of the channel
during repolarization and during rest. In our simulations, when channels
could only recover from inactivation through the open state, Ca21
leaked
from the SR for the duration of the AP preventing SR reﬁlling and normal
decay of the calcium transient. This behavior could not be observed in the
lipid bilayer experiments where RyRs were not stimulated by APs.

It has been suggested that calsequestrin (CASQ2) may also be an
important modulator of RyR activity (42,43). CASQ2 is a high-capacity,
low-afﬁnity buffer of Ca21

Simulation protocols
During pacing, a stimulus of  80 mA/mF is applied for a duration of 0.5 ms.

(49).
The model is paced with a conservative current stimulus carried by K
A discrete time step of 0.0002 ms is used during computation of the AP (or
during voltage clamp simulations) and 0.002 ms during the diastolic interval.
APD is measured as the interval between the time of maximum upstroke
velocity (dV/dtmax) and 90% repolarization (APD).

Fig. 3 A compares the simulated ICa(L) current-voltage
relationship to the experimentally measured current-voltage
relationship (50). L-type Ca21
channels typically begin to
activate between  40 and  30 mV and peak current is
reached between 0 and 110 mV. Fig. 3 C shows simulated
voltage-dependent
inactivation (VDI) properties of ICa(L)
compared to the experimentally measured data reproduced in
Fig. 3 B (51). To eliminate CDI, Findlay substituted extra-
cellular Ca21
. We eliminate CDI by not per-
mitting transitions from ModeV to ModeCa (setting transition
rates to zero). In both model and experiment, channel in-
activation increases with increased prepulse voltage and with
increased prepulse duration. Because the experiments were
conducted at 23°C, the values for the prepulse duration were
¼ 2 in the simulation.
adjusted to 37°C utilizing a Q10
Findlay observed two time constants of inactivation for the
L-type Ca21
channel. The model accounts for this observa-
tion by including two voltage-dependent inactivation states,
one for which transitions into the state are fast (IVf) and one
for which transitions are slow (IVs).

The L-type Ca21

channel Markov model recreates single
channel properties as shown in Fig. 4. The simulated open
time histogram for a voltage step to 110 mV (Fig. 4 A) can be
ﬁt by a monoexponential probability density function with a
to ¼ 0.8 ms, in agreement with the experiments of Cavalie´

et al. (52). The latency to ﬁrst opening is shown in Fig. 4 B,
with the simulation showing strong correlation to experimen-
tal data by Cavalie´ et al. (52) who observed .90% channel

completely (to zero). In the simulation (and experiment), the
tested [Ca21
]ss was applied and the model was allowed to
reach steady state at that concentration before application of
the square pulse. Hence, this study provides the steady-state
dependence of ICa(L) on [Ca21
]ss and gives no indication of
the time course of Ca21
-dependent inactivation. This time
course was determined by optimizing the morphology of
ICa(L) during the AP clamp protocol shown in Fig. 8, where
SR release was kept intact. The time course of ICa(L) recovery
from Ca21
-dependent inactivation is shown in Fig. 5 B. The
experimental data (solid circles) (54) were measured in
guinea pig ventricular myocytes at 35°C with SR Ca21

recovery is t ¼ 92 ms, and the model time constant of
recovery is t ¼ 101 ms. When we eliminate CDI in the

results that show no signiﬁcant difference in the rate of ICa(L)

cells are clamped from holding potential to  10 mV for the
trace where Ca21
is not the charge carrier (trace 3) and from
holding potential to 0 mV for the two traces where Ca21
is the
charge carrier (traces 1 and 2). In the experiment (Fig. 6 D,
trace 2), SR Ca21
release is blocked with the application
of ryanodine that we simulate by setting Irel ¼ 0 (Fig. 6 C,
trace 2). In summary, trace 1 represents total ICa(L) inactiva-
tion (VDI 1 CDI from ICa(L) and Irel), trace 2 represents ICa(L)
inactivation in the absence of SR release (VDI 1 CDI from
ICa(L) only), and trace 3 represents pure VDI (no CDI). Fig. 6, E
and F show the percent contribution to CDI from SR release
((trace 2   trace 1)/(trace 3   trace 1)) compared to the
percent contribution to CDI from Ca21
entering via ICa(L)
((trace 3   trace 2)/(trace 3   trace 1)). It is clear that Ca21
released from the SR dominates CDI initially, then, as Ca21
decreases due to SR reuptake of Ca21
, the SR dependent
contribution declines with participation from Ca21
entry via
ICa(L) dominating. For the simulated time period shown in
Fig. 6 E RyRs open quickly, inactivate, and then remain al-
most fully inactivated; thus, there is very little steady-state SR-
dependent contribution to CDI, as appears to be the case in
the SR-dependent experimental curve of Fig. 6 F. Reasons
for this observed difference can be attributed to the fact that
the experimental data were recorded in human atrial cells at
room temperature (23°C). Despite these differences, the behav-
ior of the model follows that of the experiment, especially
during the initial phase following depolarization when a sharp
decline in current is observed, correlating with the large in-
crease in [Ca21
release and
dominance of SR-dependent inactivation (Fig. 6 C, trace 1,
and E, SR-dependent curve). This initial fast decline is fol-
lowed by a much slower decrease in current (Fig. 6 C, trace 1),
a combination of VDI and CDI from Ca21
entry via ICa(L).
The crossover of the SR-dependent and ICa(L)-dependent CDI
curves occurs 36 ms after depolarization in the simulation
and 55 ms after depolarization in the experiment.

]ss during the period of SR Ca21

RyR model in the subspace: graded release,
fractional release, and variable gain
Communication between L-type Ca21
channels and RyRs
occurs in local diadic spaces and the stochastic opening of
a single L-type Ca21
channel can trigger the opening of several
local RyRs. The magnitude of Ca21
entry via ICa(L) determines
the number of RyR openings, thus small ICa(L) results in small
SR release compared to large ICa(L) resulting in large SR
release. This phenomenon is known as graded release or
graded response and is reproduced by the model as shown in
Fig. 7 A. Note that in our macroscopic formulation the spatial
distribution of RyRs is not represented and the ratio of RyR
channels that open in response to a given ICa(L) is introduced to
recreate the macroscopic properties of global release.

The model exhibits a steep nonlinear dependence of

the charge carrier relative to the inactivation when Ba21
is
the charge carrier. The experimental data (solid squares) (55)
were recorded at room temperature (23°C) so the time at
which the data are sampled is adjusted to 37°C in the sim-
ulation (Experiment: tearly ¼ 20 ms, tlate ¼ 200 ms; Sim-
ulation: tearly ¼ 8 ms, tlate ¼ 80 ms). The relative contribution

of CDI to total inactivation is both voltage dependent and
time dependent. CDI is responsible for a greater percentage
of inactivation at negative potentials when VDI is weak and
in the period shortly after depolarization. With increased time
and voltage, the contribution of CDI to total inactivation de-
creases and VDI becomes dominant.

The rate of transition between ModeV and ModeCa is
dependent on the Ca21
concentration within the subspace
([Ca21

enters the subspace via ICa(L) versus that which enters the
subspace via SR release is explored in Fig. 6, C–F. In the

model, the rate of transition between inactivated and closed
states is modulated by Ca21
-bound CASQ2 and when SR
content is low, channels are unavailable for opening.

Another property that myocytes exhibit is variable gain.
Gain is the ratio between the amount of Ca21
released from
the SR and the amount of Ca21
entry into the myocyte that
triggers SR release. In myocytes, it has been observed that
for the same amount of triggering Ca21
, the magnitude of
release can vary as a function of the transmembrane poten-
tial. For example, in Fig. 7 A, the magnitude of ICa(L) at Vm ¼
 10 mV and at Vm ¼ 130 mV is approximately the same,
but there is a large difference in the magnitude of the Ca21
transient at these two potentials, with the negative potential
exhibiting a larger SR Ca21
release. In Fig. 7 C we show the
simulated relationship between [Ca21
]i and ICa(L) over a
range of Vm values (indicated on the curve) and compare the
model results to experimentally measured data in guinea pig
ventricular myocytes (57). From the shape of the curve, it is

APD and [Ca21

]i restitution

Fig. 10, A and B, show restitution properties of the myocyte
model. The myocyte is paced at a constant cycle length until
steady state. Then a premature stimulus is applied with a

coupling interval DI (diastolic interval, DI ¼ 0 is APD90 of the
last paced AP). Fig. 10 A shows the last paced beat (CL ¼
500) and ﬁve APs with the associated ICa(L) and [Ca21
]i for
ﬁve DI values (50 ms, 150 ms, 250 ms, 350 ms, and 450 ms).
Note that at DI ¼ 50 ms a normal [Ca21
]i transient fails to
occur despite a large ICa(L) (i.e., a large triggering source).
Also, note that the CaT at DI ¼ 450 ms is larger then the CaT
generated at steady state at CL ¼ 500 ms. This is because the
DI 1 APD90 is longer than the initial CL ¼ 500 ms and the SR

has had a longer time to ﬁll and the RyR has had more time to
recover from inactivation resulting in a larger release and CaT.

An essential property of the L-type Markov model is the
ability to recreate measured ICa(L) amplitude and morphology
during the AP. Fig. 8 shows an experimentally measured
ICa(L) (nifedipine-sensitive current) (59) compared to a sim-
ulated ICa(L) during the application of an identical AP clamp
waveform (10 APs at 1 Hz). The experiment was conducted
in a guinea pig ventricular myocyte at 37°C with SR Ca21
release intact. Note that both the simulated and measured
ICa(L) exhibit a peak value of ;6 pA/pF, a period of rapid
inactivation, and a current magnitude during the AP plateau
of ;3 pA/pF.

Restitution data for three different pacing cycle lengths

(CL ¼ 1000 ms, 500 ms, and 300 ms) are shown in Fig. 10 B.
At very short DI, dV/dtmax is slow due to incomplete re-
covery of INa. This results in decreased Vmax and a larger
driving force for ICa(L), increasing the current at these short
DIs. Although the triggering source is large (Peak ICa(L)),
RyR channels remain inactivated preventing release. Only
when RyR channels have recovered from inactivation does
release occur. The duration of this interval where no SR
release can occur is dependent on the pacing frequency (Peak
RyR Open Probability and Peak Irel). This phenomenon is
related to recovery of SR Ca21
content (63) and the rela-
tionship between bound CASQ2 and RyR recovery (46,63).
At fast rates, the increased amount of Ca21
in the cytosol
(D[Ca21
]i) leads to faster recovery of SR calcium content
(Peak [Ca21
]JSR) and faster recovery of RyR and Irel (Peak
Irel). At very long DI, it can be observed that the magnitude
of Irel is strongly dependent on SR content when Peak RyR
Open Probability and Peak ICa(L) are similar in magnitude for
all three CLs.

Steady-state AP,

(CL ¼ 300 ms, gray curve) ICa(L) exhibits a larger peak and
plateau compared to slow rate (CL ¼ 1000 ms, black curve)
(B). Although there is a greater CDI at CL ¼ 300 ms due
to the larger Ca21
transient, the lower AP plateau increases
the driving force for ICa(L), resulting in a larger current. The
lower plateau and shortened APD (A) are mostly due to the
large IKs current that accumulates at fast rate (F).

The time course of L-type Ca21
channel state residencies
during the AP at fast and slow rates is shown in Fig. 12 (see
Fig. 1 for the state diagram of the channel). At the slow rate

(CL ¼ 1000 ms, black curve), almost all the channels are

able to fully recover to the closed states in ModeV (Fig. 12
B) before the pacing stimulus, whereas at the rapid rate
(CL ¼ 300 ms, gray curve) ;15% of the channels are still in
ModeCa at the time of stimulus (Fig. 12, B and G, arrows).
Despite a greater number of channels locked in ModeCa,
the magnitude of ICa(L) is larger at rapid rate due to the re-
duced Vm and increase in driving force. Upon depolariza-
tion, channels quickly move to the open state (Fig. 12 C).
From the open state, channels inactivate via either fast VDI
(IVf, Fig. 12 D) or slow VDI (IVs, Fig. 12 E). Upon the ini-
tiation of SR Ca21
release, channels transition from ModeV
to ModeCa and inactivate by CDI (Fig. 12, G–J); IVfCa and
IVsCa contain channels that have inactivated via both VDI
and CDI.

At rapid rate, a greater percentage of channels become
inactivated by CDI due to the elevated [Ca21
]i. For the rapid
rate, at t ¼100 ms after the time of stimulus, ;10% of the

channels are inactivated solely by CDI, 40% solely by VDI,
and 40% via both CDI and VDI. This is compared to 5%,
55%, and 30%, respectively, at the slow rate. The remaining
10% of channels are in either the closed or open states.

closed states (Fig. 13 D) as the SR stores recover. This re-
covery from inactivated to closed states is dependent on the
concentration of Ca21
bound CASQ2. As can be seen in Fig.
13 D, the delay of recovery from inactivation is longer at
slow rates than at fast rates. This is due to increased Ca21
loading of the myocyte at rapid rate, which allows faster
recovery of Ca21
-bound CASQ2 and, in turn, faster recovery
of RyR from inactivation after AP repolarization.

It can be observed that the RyR open probability (Fig. 13
C) at rapid rate is smaller than that at slow rate, but the
maximum SR Ca21
ﬂux is greater (Fig. 13 B). The reason for

stores ([Ca21

the decreased open probability is that 55% of the channels
remain inactivated at rapid rate (Fig. 13 E, arrow), primar-
ily due to the decreased time for recovery between beats.
Despite the decreased open probability, Irel is larger due to
the larger SR Ca21
]JSR) that result from rapid
pacing (see Fig. 11 J). Increased [Ca21
]ss (Fig. 11 H) at rapid
rate (due to increased Irel, Fig. 13 B) increases the percentage
of RyR channels that are activated by Ca21
(rightward
transition on the state diagram) and the percentage of chan-
nels that are inactivated by Ca21
(upward transition on the
state diagram). Hence, at rapid rate more channels reside in I4
and I5 compared to slow rate (Fig. 13 F).

Timothy syndrome and loss of CaV1.2 VDI

The CaV1.2 mutation G406R,
linked to the Timonthy
syndrome, almost completely removes VDI of ICa(L). In Fig.
14 A we show steady-state inactivation curves of ICa(L) for
the control model (black trace) and for G406R (gray trace)
compared to experimentally measured values (symbols).

et al. (13) showed that ;23% of CaV1.2 channels contain the
exon 8A in which the mutation G406R occurs. For this
reason we show AP (Fig. 14 B), ICa(L) (C), and CaT (D) for
three scenarios—wild-type (WT, black traces), heterozygous
expression (11.5% G406R CaV1.2 channels, dashed gray
traces), and homozygous (23% G406R CaV1.2 channels,
gray traces). The G406R mutation results in ICa(L) current
with a larger peak (Fig. 14 C, arrow) due to the loss of fast
VDI. Recovery of current during the late phase of the AP
corresponds with the decline of the CaT. This recovery from
CDI results in an increased depolarizing ICa(L) current that
prolongs APD (clinically observed as prolongation of QT
interval on the ECG) and increases myocyte Ca21
. The
increase of [Ca21
]i results from both increased Ca21
entry
via ICa(L) and reduced diastolic interval, a time during which
excess Ca21

is removed by the Na

exchanger.

DISCUSSION

In this study we present detailed kinetic models of CaV1.2 and
RyR that interact within a subcellular restricted space. These
models were incorporated into the LRd model of
the
mammalian ventricular cell with the following results: 1),
The model of CaV1.2 reproduces experimental single channel
data (mean open time, latency to ﬁrst opening) and macro-
scopic current data (VDI, CDI, recovery from inactivation,
ICa(L) during the AP). 2), The CaV1.2-RyR interaction in the

Biophysical Journal 92(5) 1522–1543

]i and the Ca21

subspace reproduces graded SR Ca21
release and voltage-
dependent variable gain of release. 3), The model accurately
reproduces adaptation of APD to changes in rate, rate de-
transient (force-frequency
pendence of [Na
relationship), and restitution properties of APD and the Ca21
transient during premature stimuli. 4), CDI of CaV1.2 is
sensitive to Ca21
that enters the subspace from L-type Ca21
channels and from SR release. The relative contributions
of these Ca21
sources to total CDI vary with time after
depolarization, with transition from early SR Ca21
dominance
to late L-type Ca21
dominance, as seen experimentally. 5),
The relative contribution of CDI to total inactivation of ICa(L) is
greater at negative potentials when VDI is weak. 6), CDI is
greater at rapid rates due to elevated subspace Ca21
. 7), Sup-
pression of VDI due to the CaV1.2 mutation G406R results in
APD prolongation and increased [Ca21

]i.

In the ICa(L) model development we utilized extensive ex-

Ca21
) as the charge carrier to
eliminate CDI. There has been some evidence to indicate that
these substitutions (speciﬁcally Ba21
may also
cause some inactivation of the channel (64). The mechanism
by which other divalent cations cause inactivation is not
known. Making the assumption that divalent cations other
than Ca21
can be used to indicate pure VDI can lead to an
overestimation of the magnitude of VDI compared to CDI.
To avoid this potential pitfall, studies of VDI have been

conducted utilizing monovalent cations as the charge carrier
(65,66). However, in these studies isoproternol (ISO) was
used to amplify the current for facilitation of measurement.
In experiments conducted by Findlay in the absence of ISO
(67), the current through ICa(L) carried by Ba21

all exhibited similar inactivation kinetics, implying that
Na

and other divalent cations are suitable substitutes for
determining VDI when ISO is absent. All simulations in this
study were conducted under such basal conditions, in the
absence of b-adrenergic effects.

ICa(L): Ca21

versus voltage dependent inactivation

There has been some debate as to which mechanism
dominates inactivation of L-type Ca21
channels, VDI, or
CDI. In our simulations, we show that in the absence of CDI,
VDI can cause .80% inactivation of the current (Fig. 3 B) for
voltage clamps to positive potentials. Experimental data of
steady-state inactivation from Linz and Meyer (66) show that
in the absence of CDI only 50% of the channels are inactivated
due to VDI for voltage clamps to positive potentials. The pri-
mary reason for differences between our simulation and the
Linz and Meyer experiments is their use of ISO in the solution.
In a series of studies (51,67–69), Findlay demonstrated that
when b-adrenergic stimulation effects were induced by the
addition of ISO to the bath solution, the contribution of VDI
to total inactivation was greatly reduced and CDI became
dominant. Findlay proposed a ‘‘switch’’ whereby phospho-
rylation of the channel turns off rapid VDI and CDI becomes
dominant (55). Our simulations are conducted in the absence
of b-adrenergic stimulation and are in agreement with Findlay
experiments conducted in the absence of ISO. In Fig. 6, A and
B, we show that the relative contributions of CDI and VDI to
total inactivation are both voltage and time dependent. We
also show that the relative contribution of CDI and VDI to
total inactivation is rate dependent (Fig. 12); speciﬁcally the
inactivation increases with
contribution of CDI to total
increased rate due to the elevation of total [Ca21
] within the
myocyte. Loss of VDI, as shown in simulations of the CaV1.2
mutation G406R (Fig. 14), leads to APD prolongation and an
increase in [Ca21
]i. It is clear that both VDI and CDI are
important mechanisms of ICa(L) inactivation. The loss of either
of these mechanisms of inactivation can lead to APD pro-
longation and calcium overload,
resulting in increased
susceptibility to arrhythmia.

It has been well established that CDI of ICa(L) occurs by
Ca21
binding to a constitutively bound calmodulin molecule
on the C-terminus of the CaV1.2 a1 subunit (22,23,70). But
there has been some evidence that Ca21
in the pore of the
channel or Ca21
very near the channel pore can also cause
CDI (71). We formulated CDI as a function of both ICa(L)
(representing Ca21
passing through the channel pore) and
[Ca21
that can bind to the C-terminus inactivation
site). However, extensive experimental data were ﬁtted by
the model with CDI dependence on [Ca21
]ss alone, sug-

ICa(L) selectivity ﬁlter
The L-type Ca21
channel is permeable to both monovalent
and divalent cations, but there has been some evidence to
suggest that when Ca21
is present, the channel is selective
almost exclusively for Ca21
and does not allow passage of
other ions (72,73). In our model of ICa(L) the channel is
permeable to Ca21

ICa(L) facilitation
L-type Ca21
channels exhibit a property whereby the channel
current magnitude increases with successive depolarizations.
This property is known as facilitation and is thought to play a
role in generating positive force frequency. ICa(L) facilitation
is not reproduced by the model presented here, but the model
still exhibits a positive force frequency relationship due to
[Ca21
]i loading at fast rate. Recent experimental evidence has
shown that ICa(L) facilitation is a result of CaMKII activation
(23,24,74–76). CaMKII is sensitive to frequency changes in
[Ca21
]i and when activated, can phosphorylate several targets
including CaV1.2, SERCA, and RyRs. A recent model of the
canine ventricular AP incorporated the CaMKII signaling
pathways and its effects on the AP and Ca21
transient (9).
Modiﬁcation of this signaling pathway for inclusion in the
guinea pig myocyte model could be done in future develop-
ment to incorporate ICa(L) facilitation. ICa(L) is also augmented
by b-adrenergic stimulation (77). The simulations in this
study are conducted under basal conditions in the absence of
b-adrenergic effects. Models of the b-adrenergic signaling
pathway (78) could also be adapted and incorporated in the
cell model for studies of cellular behavior under various levels
of b-adrenergic tone.

Gain and local control of SR Ca21

release

theory of SR Ca21

release says that

the
Local control
individual discrete openings of single L-type Ca21
channels
signal the opening of nearby RyRs, the Ca21
from which can
recruit adjacent RyRs leading to SR release. This concept is
important for understanding variable gain of SR release,
where it is observed that for the same magnitude of ICa(L),
a larger release is achieved at negative potentials than at
positive potentials. The idea is that at negative potentials
fewer CaV1.2 channels open but because the driving force
for Ca21
enters through the
open channels creating sufﬁcient local Ca21
levels to trigger

is large, a large amount of Ca21

Faber et al.

local RyR openings. At positive potentials, many more
CaV1.2 channels will open, but
the average current per
channel will be low because of a small driving force.
Consequently, at some sites [Ca21
]ss is not large enough to
trigger opening of local RyRs. There have been important
modeling efforts to recreate local control of SR release at the
level of these local interactions (17,18,79–81). The whole-
cell model presented here uses a global formulation of Irel
to achieve graded response and variable gain. Using this
macroscopic formulation, the model recreates behavior of
ICa(L), Irel, and [Ca21
]i that corresponds well to experimen-
tally measured data at a variety of test potentials and pacing
rates. This approach is computationally efﬁcient and permits
simulating cellular behavior over many beats of pacing and
during AP propagation in the multicellular tissue, a property
that is necessary for studying cardiac arrhythmias. However,
microscopic details of local control dynamics are not rep-
resented explicitly in the model.

-dependent inactivation and adaptation

RyR Ca21
The mechanism that terminates SR Ca21
release is not fully
understood and several possible control mechanisms have
been proposed (16). There has been evidence that RyR
channels do not undergo Ca21
-dependent inactivation (82),
contrary to the proposed RyR kinetic model presented here.
Suggested mechanisms of SR release termination, such as
stochastic attrition (83) (closure of RyR channels and their
neighbors due to reduction of local Ca21
as a result of spon-
taneous stochastic closure of local RyRs) and RyR adaptation
(a decrease of RyR sensitivity to local Ca21
following a Ca21
stimulus, a process distinct from inactivation in that the
channels can exhibit further opening following an additional,
larger Ca21
stimulus) cannot be replicated in this study with-
out including a more detailed model of local control (17,18,84)
and/or RyR kinetics (41,85). Another proposed mechanism of
SR Ca21
release termination is due to depletion of luminal
Ca21
(46,63,86). This mechanism is similar to the CASQ2-
mediated recovery from inactivation in the model presented
here. In our formulation, both cytosolic and luminal SR Ca21
(via CASQ2) play an important role in RyR inactivation and
RyR recovery from inactivation. Despite the lack of clarity
concerning RyR inactivation and SR Ca21
release termina-
tion, the RyR model presented here accurately recreates the
time course and magnitude of SR Ca21
release for a multitude
of voltage clamp protocols and pacing frequencies necessary
for validating the CaV1.2 model and its use in the simulations
presented.

Rates of RyR activation and deactivation were increased from those based
on lipid-bilayer studies in the original publication of Fill et al. (39) to ac-
count for differences in temperature and to create an SR ﬂux that generates a
time course and magnitude of the CaT that closely ﬁt experimentally re-
corded values. For this reason, the rates were not increased uniformly. The
activation rate a1R was increased 3.5 times, and a2R, a3R, and a4R were in-
creased seven times. The deactivation rates b1R, b2R, and b3R were increased
ﬁve times and the deactivation rate b4R was increased 25 times.

Derivation of subspace volume

We assume a myocyte with a radius of 11 mm and length of 100 mm with
Z-lines spaced by 1.85 mm. T-tubules protrude into the myocyte along the
Z-lines with spacing of 1.5 mm. With these values, we compute 54 Z-lines
per myocyte with 46 t-tubules per Z-line for a total of 2484 t-tubules
per myocyte. The diameter of each t-tubule is 0.3 mm and the distance be-
tween the SR membrane and the t-tubule is 0.02 mm (15). The volume of
subspace along the length of a single t-tubule to the center of the myocyte is:
