Abstract

Many drugs inhibit human ether-a-go-go related gene (HERG) current and prolong cardiac action potential duration. We examined the
kinetic properties of quinidine block of HERG channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes in comparison with those of the block by a class III
antiarrhythmic dofetilide. Both of the drugs inhibited HERG currents in a use-dependent and frequency-independent manner. However, the
underlying mechanisms were different. Under the steady state, quinidine block was voltage- and time-dependent. At positive membrane
potentials, the onset of block was very fast. Thus, quinidine caused frequency-independent block mainly through this fast blocking kinetic. In
contrast, dofetilide blocked HERG currents in a voltage- and time-independent manner under the steady state because of very slow
unblocking at negative potentials, which also caused frequency-independent block. Therefore, quinidine and dofetilide might cause the
reverse frequency-dependent prolongation of action potential duration through distinct mechanisms with regard to blocking and unblocking
kinetics.

1. Introduction

The delayed rectifier K+ current, IK, contributes to the
phase-2 and phase-3 repolarization of the cardiac action
potential, and thus controls its duration. In many mamma-
the delayed outward K+
lian species including human,
current, IK, is composed of at least two distinct components,
rapidly and slowly activating K+ currents, IKr and IKs,
respectively (Sanguinetti and Jurkiewicz, 1990, 1991; Wang
et al., 1994; Li et al., 1996). The human ether-a-go-go
related gene (HERG) encodes the pore forming subunit of
the IKr channel (Sanguinetti et al., 1995; Trudeau et al.,
1995). Loss of function type-mutations in this gene are
associated with type 2 of the inherited form of long QT
syndrome (Curran et al., 1995; Sanguinetti et al., 1996).
Many drugs are also known to block IKr and cause acquired
forms of QT prolongation and potentially fatal cardiac
arrhythmias (Roden, 2000). They include methanesulfona-
nilide class III antiarrhythmic agents (e.g., E-4031 and

dofetilide), the class Ia agents (e.g., quinidine and disopyr-
amide), antihistamine derivatives (terfenadine and astemi-
zole) and many others including antibiotics and tranquilizers.
To use these drugs safely, it is important to understand the
mechanisms by which they induce QT prolongation and fatal
cardiac arrhythmias.

IKr contributes to the cardiac action potential repolariza-
tion more than IKs in bradycardia, and vice versa in
tachycardia (Jurkiewicz and Sanguinetti, 1993). Thus, the
drugs selectively inhibiting IKr may prolong action potential
duration more prominently in bradycardia than in tachycar-
dia. This phenomenon is referred to as ‘‘reverse’’ frequency
dependency and may be at least partly responsible for drug-
induced excessive prolongation of action potential duration
and torsades de pointes which are often seen during
bradycardia (Hondeghem and Snyders, 1990). E-4031 and
dofetilide exhibit
these properties (Okada et al., 1996;
Toyama et al., 1997; Marschang et al., 1998). Their fre-
quency-independent block of IKr channels is shown to result
from very slow unblocking at negative potentials (Carme-
liet, 1992; Toyama et al., 1997).

We previously showed that vesnarinone, a positive ino-
in a frequency-

tropic agent, blocks the HERG current

dependent manner because its unblocking occurs rapidly at
diastolic membrane potentials (Katayama et al., 2000). This
drug prolongs action potential duration of rabbit ventricular
myocytes without reverse frequency dependency (Toyama
et al., 1997) and much less frequently causes torsades de
pointes than E-4031 or dofetilide (Feldman et al., 1991).
Therefore,
the proarrhythmic effect of the IKr-blocking
drugs seems to differ depending upon their blocking and
unblocking kinetics of HERG current.

It is also known that the widely used class Ia antiarrhyth-
mic quinidine prolongs action potential duration in a reverse
frequency-dependent manner (Roden and Hoffman, 1985;
Roden et al., 1987) and often causes torsades de pointes
(Smith and Gallagher, 1980). Quinidine blocks not only the
Na+ channel but also many K+ channels of cardiac myo-
cytes. The proarrhythmic action of quinidine is thought to
arise mainly from the block of IKr channels (Yang and
Roden, 1996; Po et al., 1999; Lees-Miller et al., 2000; Ishii
et al., 2001). Recently, the kinetic properties of quinidine
block of HERG channels have been reported by several
groups. Quinidine blocks HERG current
in a use- and
voltage-dependent manner and shows a rapid onset of block
at depolarized potentials (Paul et al., 2002; Weerapura et al.,
2002; Sanchez-Chapula et al., 2003). However, the frequen-
cy dependency and recovery of the quinidine block of
HERG channels has not been thoroughly examined.

In this study, we examined and compared the kinetic
properties of the quinidine and dofetilide block of HERG
channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes in detail using the
same technique and protocols. Thus, we can directly
compare the mechanisms underlying the block of HERG
channels by these drugs. Quinidine caused a frequency-
independent block of HERG channels like dofetilide. Howe-
ver, they did so through distinct mechanisms. At depolarized
potentials, dofetilide caused voltage- and time-independent
block, whereas quinidine caused voltage-dependent and
very rapid onset of block. At negative potentials, blocking
by dofetilide was virtually irreversible, whereas quinidine
showed rapid unblocking. Therefore, quinidine caused the
frequency-independent block mainly through its rapid
blocking kinetics, whereas dofetilide did so through its
slow unblocking. Therefore, it is plausible that quinidine
and dofetilide cause the reverse frequency-dependent pro-
longation of action potential duration through distinct me-
chanisms with regard to blocking and unblocking kinetics.
This notion has not been clearly recognized but would be
important to understand the mechanism underlying the anti-
and proarrhythmic effects of these agents.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Transcription of cRNA

HERG cDNA in pSP64 was kindly provided by Drs.
M.T. Keating and M.C. Sanguinetti (University of Utah, Salt

Lake City, UT). The pSP64 construct containing HERG was
linearized with EcoRI (Takara, Otsu, Japan) and transcribed
in vitro with SP6 polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
Human MinK-related peptide 1 (MiRP1) cDNA subcloned
into pGEMHE vector was linearized with NheI (Takara) and
transcribed in vitro with T7 polymerase (Invitrogen). The
cRNAs were stabilized with m7G(5V) ppp(5V)G RNA Cap-
ping analogue (Invitrogen).

2.2. Isolation of oocytes and injection of cRNA

Frogs were treated in accordance with the guidelines
for the use of laboratory animals of Osaka University
Graduate School of Medicine. Isolation and maintenance
of Xenopus laevis and injection with cRNA were per-
formed as described previously (Chachin et al., 1999).
Frogs were deeply anesthetized by immersion in 0.35%
tricaine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 30 min. Ovarian lobes
were surgically removed under clean conditions and
digested with 1 mg/ml collagenase S-1 (Nitta-gelatin,
Osaka, Japan) in Ca2 +-free OR 2 solution (82.5 mM
NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2 and 5 mM HEPES,
pH 7.5 with NaOH) for 90 min to remove follicle cells.
Stage V and VI oocytes were injected with 2 ng of HERG
cRNA. Oocytes were cultured in ND 96 solution (96 mM
NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2 and 5
mM HEPES, pH 7.5 with NaOH) supplemented with 50
Ag/ml gentamicin at 18 jC.

MiRP1 is a h-subunit of IKr (Abbot et al., 1999). We
examined whether quinidine or dofetilide caused distinct
effects on currents mediated by HERG alone and by HERG
and MiRP1. In these experiments, 1 ng of MiRP1 cRNA
was coinjected with 2 ng of HERG cRNA. However, the
drugs caused virtually identical kinetic and concentration-
dependent effects on the two types of channel currents (data
not shown). Therefore, we utilized oocytes expressing
HERG channels alone in the present study.

2.3. Electrophysiological recording

Currents were recorded by a conventional two-electrode
voltage clamp method with a Turbo Clamp TEC 01C
amplifier (npi electronic, Tamm, Germany) 2 to 3 days
after injection of cRNA to oocytes. Oocytes were bathed
in ND 96 solution. The glass microelectrodes had a
resistance of 0.5 – 1.0 MV when filled with 3 M KCl. At
the end of each experiment, an excessive concentration of
dofetilide (30 AM) was applied to the oocytes to com-
pletely suppress HERG currents and estimate endogenous
currents in oocytes. HERG currents were defined as the
maximum dofetilide-sensitive components of the mem-
brane currents. All experiments were conducted at room
temperature (22 – 24 jC).

All electrophysiological data were stored on videotapes
using a PCM data recorder (NF Electronic Design, Tokyo,
Japan) and subsequently reproduced for off-line analysis

with commercially available software (Patch Analyst Pro,
MT, Hyogo, Japan).

2.4. Data analysis

All data are presented as mean F standard error of mean

(S.E.M.).

The relationship between the concentration of the drugs
and the current amplitude was fitted by the following Hill
equation:
Relative current ¼ 1=ð1 þ ð½drug=IC50ÞhÞ;

ð1Þ

is the current amplitude in the
where relative current
presence of the drug normalized to that in the absence of
the drug; IC50, the half-maximum inhibitory concentration
of quinidine; and h, the Hill coefficient.

2.5. Drugs

Quinidine sulfate (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) were
dissolved at 10 mM in distilled water. Dofetilide was a gift
from Pfizer Pharmaceutical (New York, NY) and dissolved
at 10 mM in distilled water at pH 3.0. For use, these agents
were diluted to the desired concentration in ND96 solution,
and the pH was adjusted to 7.5 when necessary.

3. Results

3.1. Use and frequency dependency of the block of HERG
channels by quinidine and dofetilide

Firstly, we examined use and frequency dependency of
the block of HERG channels by quinidine or dofetilide. As
shown in Fig. 1A, HERG currents were elicited by 0.5 s
voltage steps to + 40 mV from the holding potential of   80
mV with different cycle lengths (1 – 10 s) in the absence of
drugs (control) until
the HERG current became stable.
Thereafter, 10 AM quinidine or 100 nM dofetilide was
added to the bath while the membrane potential was held
at   80 mV. Five minutes later, the same voltage pulses
were resumed to examine the drug-effect (Fig. 1A).

Quinidine blocked the HERG current in a use-dependent
manner (Fig. 1B). During the first voltage step pulse after
the application of quinidine, the initial peak current was
little suppressed but the current gradually became smaller
(Fig. 1B). The current during the second pulse was largely
suppressed from the beginning but still larger than that in
the third one. The current amplitude reached the steady-state
level after the third pulse irrespective of cycle lengths (Figs.
1B,C). Therefore, quinidine blocked HERG channels in a
use-dependent and frequency-independent manner.

On the other hand, dofetilide suppressed the HERG
current very slowly (Fig. 1D,E,
left panel). More than
1000 pulses were needed for dofetilide to cause the

indicating that

steady-state block. Both the extent of block during each
pulse and the steady-state block were independent of the
cycle length (Fig. 1E, right panel),
the
recovery from the bock by dofetilide hardly occurs at
  80 mV. Therefore, dofetilide also blocked HERG chan-
nels in a use-dependent and frequency-independent manner,
as previously reported for the effect of methanesulfonanilide
class III antiarrhythmic agents including E-4031 and dofe-
tilide on cardiac IKr (Carmeliet, 1992; Toyama et al., 1997).
But the time course of current alteration during voltage
pulses was different between quinidine and dofetilide.

3.2. Concentration-dependent block of HERG channel
currents by quinidine and dofetilide

Fig. 2A shows the voltage clamp protocol to analyze the
concentration-dependent effect of the drugs. The membrane
potential was depolarized to + 20 mV for 4 s and then
repolarized to   60 mV for 6 s. These pulses were repeated
every 30 s until the current amplitude reached the steady
state in the absence and presence of each concentration of
drugs.

Fig. 2B shows the effect of 3, 10 and 30 AM quinidine on
HERG currents in the steady state. Quinidine inhibited these
currents in a concentration-dependent manner. The relation-
ship between the concentration of quinidine and the ampli-
tude of HERG current at the end of the test pulse is shown in
Fig. 2C. Fitting of the data with the Hill equation Eq. (1)
indicated an IC50 value of 2.5 AM and a Hill coefficient of
0.99.

Quinidine also slowed the decay of tail currents as shown
by the crossover of tail current recorded in the absence and
presence of 3 AM quinidine (large arrow head). The decay
of the tail currents was fit with a double exponential
function (Table 1). The time constants of both the fast and
slow components (sfast, sslow) became larger at higher
concentration of quinidine. The fraction of the slow com-
ponent was significantly larger in the presence than absence
of quinidine. Thus, quinidine slowed the decay of the tail
current in a concentration-dependent manner. The area un-
der the tail current was 0.69 F 0.08, 0.69 F 0.09, 0.48 F
0.05 and 0.22 F 0.01 AAs in the absence and presence of 3,
10 and 30 AM quinidine, respectively. These results suggest
that the channels can move from blocked to the closed
state(s) without passing through the open state upon repo-
larization (see Discussion).

Fig. 2D shows the effect of 30, 100 and 300 nM
dofetilide on HERG currents. Dofetilide also inhibited these
currents in a concentration-dependent manner. The relation-
ship between the concentration of dofetilide and the ampli-
tude of HERG current at the end of the test pulse is shown in
Fig. 2E. Fitting of the data with the Hill equation Eq. (1)
indicated an IC50 value of 73 nM and a Hill coefficient of
1.4.

The decay of the tail current in the presence of dofetilide
was also fit with a double exponential function (Table 2).

Fig. 1. Use-dependent and frequency-independent block of HERG channels by quinidine and dofetilide. (A) The voltage clamp protocol to evoke HERG
currents expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Firstly, 0.5 s duration voltage steps to + 40 mV were applied from the holding potential of   80 mV every 1, 2, 3 or
10 s in the absence of drugs (the first run). Then, 10 AM quinidine or 100 nM dofetilide was applied to the bath while the membrane potential was held at   80
mV. Five minutes later, the same protocol was repeated with the same cycle lengths (the second run). (B) HERG currents measured with a cycle length of 10 s
in the absence and presence of 10 AM quinidine. Top panel: the voltage clamp pulse. Bottom panel: HERG currents elicited by the first pulse in the first run
(control), and by the first to tenth pulses in the second run (quinidine 1st – 10th). The arrow head indicates the zero current level. (C) Frequency dependence of
quinidine block of HERG channels. The amplitude of HERG currents at the peak (left) or at the end of the 0.5 s voltage pulse (right) in the second run were
normalized to their corresponding amplitude in the first run and plotted against time after application of the first pulse of the second run. The cycle length was 1
(.), 3 (D) or 10 s (5). Symbols represent mean values (n = 5 for each point). S.E.M. is not shown for clarity. (D) HERG currents measured with a cyclic length
of 2 s in the absence and presence of 300 nM dofetilide. HERG currents elicited by the first pulse in the first run (control), and by the 100, 200, 300, 400, 500,
600, 700, 800, 900, 1000th pulses in the second run. (E) Frequency dependence of dofetilide block of HERG channels. The amplitude of HERG currents at the
peak of the 0.5 s voltage pulse in the second run were normalized to their corresponding amplitude in the first run and plotted against time after application of

the first pulse of the second run (left) or against the number pulses applied (right). The cycle length was 1 (.), 2 (y), 3 (D) or 10 s (5). Symbols represent mean

values (n = 4 for each point). For each cycle length, one point every 50 measured points is plotted to simplify the graph. S.E.M. is not shown.

Although dofetilide did not cause the crossover of tail
current, both sfast, and sslow in the presence of 300 nM
dofetilide were significantly larger than those in the absence
of dofetilide, and the fraction of the slow component was
significantly larger in the presence than absence of 100 or
300 nM dofetilide. Therefore, dofetilide also slows the
decay of the tail current albeit much more weakly than
quinidine.

3.3. Voltage-dependent block of HERG channel currents by
quinidine

We next examined the voltage dependency of the block
of HERG channels by quinidine. The same voltage pulses
as shown in Fig. 2A were applied in the absence and
presence of different concentrations of quinidine. After the
current amplitude reached the steady-state level under each

condition, the voltage pulses shown in the top panel of Fig.
3A were applied. In this voltage protocol, the membrane
potential was depolarized from   80 mV to test potentials
ranging from   60 to + 60 mV for 4 s in 10 mV incre-
ments and then repolarized to   60 mV for 6 s every 30 s.
The steady-state effects of 3, 10, and 30 AM quinidine on
HERG currents evoked by voltage steps to   20 (left) and
+ 40 mV (right) are shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 3A.
A given concentration of quinidine inhibited HERG cur-
rents more strongly at + 40 than at   20 mV. Quinidine not
only suppressed the peak but slowed the decay of tail
currents upon repolarization, as clearly indicated by the
observation that the tail current in the presence of 3 AM
quinidine crossed that in the absence of the drug (arrow
heads).

The current – voltage relationships at the pulse end in the
presence of various concentrations of quinidine are shown

Fig. 2. Concentration-dependent effects of quinidine and dofetilide on HERG currents. (A) The voltage clamp protocol. The membrane potential was
depolarized from   80 to + 20 mV for 4 s and then repolarized to   60 mV for 6 s. The entire stimulus protocol was applied every 30 s. (B and D) HERG
currents recorded from an oocyte in the absence and presence of 3, 10 and 30 AM of quinidine (B) or in the absence and presence of 30, 100 and 300 nM of
dofetilide (C). The currents were measured after the effects of drug reached the maximum steady-state level. A large arrow head in (B) indicates crossover of
the tail current recorded in the absence of quinidine and that recorded in the presence of 3 AM quinidine. (C and E) The concentration – response relationship of
the quinidine (C) and dofetilide (E) block of HERG currents. The current amplitude at the end of the step to + 20 mV in the presence of each drug was
normalized to that in the absence of the drug. Symbols and bars indicate the mean and S.E.M. (n = 5 for each point). The lines represent fits to the data of the
Hill equation Eq. (1) with an IC50 of 2.5 AM and a Hill coefficient of 0.99 for quinidine (D) and an IC50 of 73 nM and a Hill coefficient of 1.4 for dofetilide (E).

in Fig. 3B. In the absence of quinidine,
the current
amplitude at pulse-end increased from   50 mV to 0 mV
and then decreased from + 10 to + 60 mV. This inward
rectification of HERG current is due to the fast C-type
inactivation of the channel (Smith et al., 1996). In the
presence of quinidine,
the current amplitude was sup-
pressed at all membrane potentials in a concentration-
dependent manner. The peak of the current – voltage (I –
V) curve, however, shifted slightly to the left, suggesting

applied in the absence and presence of each concentration of quinidine. After the current amplitude reached the steady-state level under each condition, the
voltage pulses shown here were applied. The membrane potential was depolarized from   80 mV to test potentials ranging from   60 to + 60 mV for 4 s in 10

3 AM (
the end of the 4 s test pulse (B) or at the peak of HERG tail currents (C) and plotted against the test potential. (D and E) The HERG current amplitude at each
o
), 10 AM (.), and 30 AM quinidine (E) was normalized to the corresponding value recorded in the absence of
membrane potential in the presence of 3 AM (
the drug. Symbols and bars indicate the mean and S.E.M. (n = 4 for each point). The current amplitude was measured at the end of the 4 s test pulse (D) or at the
peak of HERG tail currents (E).

Quinidine inhibited both test pulse-end and peak tail
currents in a concentration-dependent manner at all poten-
tials. At a given concentration, the quinidine block was
stronger as the membrane potential became more positive.
Extrapolation of these curves suggests that quinidine might
have little effect upon HERG channels at highly negative
membrane potentials. Although the amplitudes of the
relative step-end current at >0 mV seem to be slightly
larger than that at 0 mV (Fig. 3D), there is no statistical
difference among the amplitudes of the currents between 0
and + 60 mV in the presence of each concentration of
quinidine.

3.4. Voltage-independent block of HERG channel currents
by dofetilide

We next examined the voltage dependency of the block
of HERG channels by dofetilide. The pulse protocol was the
same as in Fig. 3. The current – voltage relationships were
examined after the current amplitude reached the steady-
state level both in the absence and presence of different
concentrations of dofetilide. The steady-state effects of 30,
100 and 300 nM dofetilide on HERG currents evoked by
voltage pulses to   20 mV (left) and + 40 mV (right) are
shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 4A. Dofetilide inhibited

concentration-dependent manner but did not cause the
crossover of tail current.

The effects of different concentrations of dofetilide on
the amplitudes of pulse-end and peak tail currents are shown
in Fig. 4B and C, respectively. Dofetilide inhibited both
currents in a concentration-dependent manner at all poten-
tials. In contrast to quinidine, the peak of the I – V curve in
the presence of dofetilide did not shift, suggesting that the
effect of dofetilide was independent of membrane potential.
In Fig. 4D and E, the amplitudes of pulse-end and peak
tail currents in the presence of dofetilide were normalized to

those in its absence and plotted against each test pulse
potential. The effect of dofetilide was not different at
different test potentials.

3.5. Time dependency of
currents by quinidine and dofetilide

the block of HERG channel

We next examined the time courses of quinidine and
dofetilide block during test pulses to different membrane
potentials. Again, the voltage pulses shown in Fig. 2A were
repeatedly applied until the current amplitude reached the
steady state in the absence and presence of 10 AM quinidine

or 100 nM dofetilide. Thereafter, the voltage pulses shown
in Fig. 5A were applied. In this protocol, the membrane was
depolarized from the holding potential of   80 mV to the
potentials between   20 and + 40 mV for 2 s in 20 mV
increments every 30 s. Fig. 5B shows the current traces
recorded in the steady-state in the absence and presence of
quinidine (10 AM) during voltage pulses to   20 mV (top
panel) and + 20 mV (bottom panel). At   20 mV, 10 AM
quinidine had little effect on the current at the beginning of
the voltage step but then time-dependently inhibited it. This
is consistent with our estimation that quinidine had only
slightly blocked the channel at the negative holding poten-
tial of   80 mV. To compare the time course of quinidine
block at   20, 0, + 20 and + 40 mV, HERG currents
recorded in the presence of 10 AM quinidine were normal-
ized to those recorded in the absence of the drug at each
membrane potential (Fig. 5C). At all test potentials, the
block was composed of two time-dependent components,
fast and slow. The fast component became larger at more
depolarized potentials and the time required for the current
inhibition became smaller as the test potential was more
positive, although in our present measurement,
it was
the fast component accurately. The half
difficult
inhibition occurred at 0.23 F 0.03 s at   20 mV, 0.065 F
0.009 s at 0 mV, 0.029 F 0.003 s at + 20 mV and

to fit

0.018 F 0.002 s at + 40 mV (n = 5 for each). Thus, the
kinetics of quinidine block was also voltage dependent as
was the case for the extent of the block (Fig. 3D,E).

Fig. 5D shows the current traces recorded in the steady
state in the absence and presence of 100 nM dofetilide
during voltage pulses to   20 (top panel) and + 20 mV
(bottom panel). In contrast to quinidine, dofetilide caused a
significant block from the beginning of the voltage pulse at
both   20 and + 20 mV. In Fig. 5E, the HERG currents
recorded in the presence of 100 nM dofetilide were nor-
malized to those recorded in the absence of the drug at each
membrane potential. The block by dofetilide was time- and
voltage-independent.

3.6. Recovery from block by quinidine and dofetilide

We finally examined the time course of recovery from
the block by quinidine and dofetilide with a double-pulse
voltage protocol (Fig. 6A). Firstly, 5 s voltage steps to + 40
mV were applied from   80 mV with a cycle length of 10 s
to induces the steady-state block in the absence and pres-
ence of 10 AM quinidine or 100 nM dofetilide. Thereafter,
the voltage pulses shown in Fig. 6A were applied. Because
the recovery of quinidine block at   80 mV was fast and the
onset of block was also very rapid during the depolarizing

were repeatedly applied until the current amplitude reached the steady state in the absence and presence of 10 AM quinidine or 100 nM dofetilide. Thereafter,
the voltage pulses shown here were applied. The membrane was depolarized from the holding potential of   80 mV to the potentials between   20 and + 40
mV for 2 s in 20 mV increments. (B and D) Superimposed current traces recorded during voltage steps to   20 mV (top panel) and + 20 mV (bottom panel) in
the absence (control) and presence of 10 AM quinidine (B) or 100 nM dofetilide (D). (C and E) HERG currents recorded in the presence of 10 AM quinidine (C)
or 100 nM dofetilide (E) were normalized to those in the absence of the drug at different membrane potentials (dots). Solid lines in the left and right graphs are
the fit with a single exponential or linear function of the data, respectively.

Fig. 6. Recovery of HERG channels from quinidine and dofetilide block at   80 mV. (A) The voltage clamp protocol. Two successive depolarizing pulses
(P1 to + 40 mV and P2 to   20 mV) of 2 s in duration were applied from the holding potential of   80 mV with varying intervals (Dtime of 0 to 10 s).
This pulse protocol was first applied in the absence of drugs. Then, drugs were applied while the membrane potential was held at   80 mV. Five minutes
later, 5 s voltage steps to + 40 mV were applied from   80 mV with a cycle length of 10 s to induce the steady-state block. Thereafter, the same double-
pulse protocol was repeated. (B) HERG currents recorded in P2 with interpulse duration of 0, 0.2, 1 and 5 s in the presence of 10 AM quinidine (left) or
100 nM dofetilide (right) were normalized to those in the absence of the drug. The abscissa indicates the time after application of P2. Solid lines in the left
and right graphs are the fit with a single exponential or linear function of the data, respectively. (C) The extent of the block by 10 AM quinidine (left) or
100 nM dofetilide (right) at the beginning of P2 was estimated by extrapolating the solid lines in (B) toward the time 0. These values were plotted against
the interval between P1 and P2. Symbols and bars indicate the mean and S.E.M. (n = 4 for each point). The solid line in the left graph is the fit to the data
of a single exponential function with a time constant of 1.44 s, whereas that in the right graph is a linear regression fit to the data.

pulse, we estimated the recovery as follows. The membrane
was first depolarized to + 40 mV (P1) for 2 s to induce the
steady-state block and then repolarized to   80 mV. After
the membrane potential was held at   80 mV for various
durations (0 to 10 s), the membrane potential was depolar-
ized for 2 s to   20 mV (P2), at which the quinidine does
not block HERG channels very rapidly (Fig. 5B and C).
HERG currents recorded in the presence of 10 AM quinidine
or 100 nM dofetilide in P2 were normalized to those
recorded in the absence of the drugs (Fig. 6B). The
normalized currents in the presence of quinidine or dofeti-
lide were fit with a single exponential and linear function,
respectively (Fig. 6B). The availability of HERG channels
at the beginning of P2 was estimated by extrapolating the

curves or lines toward time 0. These estimated values were
plotted against the interval between P1 and P2 in Fig. 6C.
The quinidine block at + 40 mV reduced at   80 mV with a
time constant of 1.44 F 0.32 s, whereas the dofetilide block
showed no recovery within 10 s (Fig. 6B,C, right).

4. Discussion

4.1. Comparison of the kinetic properties of HERG channel
block by quinidine, dofetilide and vesnarinone

We showed that both quinidine and dofetilide blocked
HERG channel currents expressed in Xenopus oocytes in a

38

K. Tsujimae et al. / European Journal of Pharmacology 493 (2004) 29–40

use-dependent and frequency-independent manner. The use
dependency may indicate that these agents are so-called
open channel blockers. These results agree with previously
results (Snyders and Chaudhary, 1996; Weerapura et al.,
2002).

The frequency-independent block of these drugs arose
from different mechanisms. Dofetilide blocked the HERG
current in a voltage- and time-independent manner (Figs. 4
and 5). This turned out to be due to little recovery from the
drug effect at negative potentials (Fig. 6B and C). This is the
major mechanism for dofetilide-induced frequency-indepen-
dent block. In contrast, quinidine block of HERG channels
exhibited a prominent voltage and time dependency (Figs. 3,
5 and 6) as reported previously (Paul et al., 2002; Weerapura
et al., 2002). At positive membrane potentials, the block
occurred very rapidly within 100 – 200 ms (Fig. 5C). Re-
covery from the block occurred with a time constant of ~1.5
s at   80 mV (Fig. 6C). This suggests that quinidine should
cause the frequency-dependent block. However, the onset of
quinidine block is so rapid (i.e., t1/2 = 18 ms at + 40 mV)
that quinidine block reaches the steady-state level within
several hundreds milliseconds. As a result, quinidine
blocked HERG channels in a frequency-independent man-
ner. Therefore, quinidine and dofetilide cause the frequency-
independent block through distinct mechanisms.

It

is usually difficult to directly extrapolate the drug
effects on HERG channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes
to those on native cardiac IKr channels. For example, around
10 times higher concentrations of drugs are required to
cause the same extent of block of HERG currents expressed
in Xenopus oocytes than those expressed in mammalian
cells or native cardiac IKr currents. This is probably because
oocytes have the yolk and vitelline membrane. Therefore,
the concentrations of quinidine and dofetilide used in this
study would be much higher than those causing the equiv-
alent effect on native cardiac IKr currents. However, the rank
order of the potency of drugs assessed in oocytes is
compatible with that determined in mammalian cells
(Witchel et al., 2002). In addition, the onset of block of
HERG currents by quinidine is much faster than that by
dofetilide whether these are assessed in either oocytes or
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (Weerapura et al.,
2002). For these reasons, we consider that it is possible to
estimate the effect of drugs on native cardiac IKr currents
from the present results at least qualitatively.

From this aspect, we propose that quinidine and dofeti-
lide may cause the reverse frequency-dependent prolonga-
tion of cardiac action potential
through the common
frequency-independent block of the IKr channels resulting
from the distinct mechanisms. We also suggest that the
effect of HERG channel blockers on cardiac action potential
can be significantly affected by the block and unblock
kinetics of each agent as is the case for Na+ channel
blockers (Hondeghem and Katzung, 1984).

We previously reported that vesnarinone causes a fre-
quency-dependent block of HERG channels expressed in a

mammalian cell line (Katayama et al., 2000). The drug did
not show use dependence and exhibited a voltage- and time-
dependent block during depolarizing voltage steps. Vesnar-
inone (1 AM) blocked HERG channels with a time constant
of 0.89 s at + 20 mV and unblocking occurred with a time
constant of 1.75 s at   80 mV (Katayama et al., 2000).
Thus, vesnarinone seems to be in between dofetilide and
quinidine in terms of the blocking and unblocking kinetics.
The effect of vesnarinone did not accumulate as long as
depolarizing pulses are applied at cycle lengths of
12 s
but did so with shorter cyclic lengths (Katayama et al.,
2000). Thus, vesnarinone blocked HERG channels in a
frequency-dependent manner in contrast with dofetilide or
quinidine (Katayama et al., 2000). This phenomenon under-
lies the prolongation of the action potential duration of
rabbit ventricular myocytes without reverse frequency de-
pendency by vesnarinone (Toyama et al., 1997).

4.2. Interaction of quinidine with HERG channels

Quinidine blocks not only IKr but also IKs channels (Yao
et al., 1996; Kang et al., 2001). However, much higher
concentrations of quinidine are required to inhibit IKs than
IKr. The IC50 values of quinidine block of recombinant IKs
channels at + 20 mV are 44 AM when expressed in Chinese
hamster ovary (CHO) cells (Kang et al., 2001) and 585 AM
for those expressed in Xenopus oocytes (Yao et al., 1996).
Because these values are higher than the therapeutic con-
centration of quinidine (6 – 15 AM; Yang et al., 2001), the
clinical effect of the agent would mainly result from its
block of IKr currents.

That quinidine slowed the decay of HERG channel tail
currents was indicated by the crossover of tail currents
recorded in the absence and presence of 3 AM quinidine
(Figs. 2A and 3A, arrow head). This observation is consis-
tent with previously published data (Sanchez-Chapula et al.,
2003). Similar effects upon HERG tail currents are reported
in the effects of verapamil (Zhang et al., 1999) and cocaine
and its metabolites (Ferreira et al., 2001). Quinidine also
slows the decay of the tail current of human Kv1.5, a type of
voltage-dependent K+ channel (Snyders et al., 1992;
Snyders and Yeola, 1995). This slowing of deactivation is
usually interpreted as suggesting that the channels must
transit an open state(s) in moving from blocked to closed
state(s). In this case, the area under the tail current should be
the same in the presence and absence of a blocker. This was,
however, not the case for quinidine block of HERG chan-
nels. The area under the tail current became smaller at
higher concentration of quinidine (see Section 3.2). It is,
therefore, possible that
the HERG channel blocked by
quinidine can move to the closed state(s) without passing
through the open state at negative potentials. Through this
mechanism, quinidine may effectively suppress the tail
current despite its fast unblocking kinetics. On the other
hand, dofetilide modestly slowed the decay of the tail
current only at high concentrations (Table 2).

Quinidine blocks HERG channels at positive potentials
such as + 60 mV (Fig. 3). This suggests that
the
quinidine blocks the inactivated HERG channel as well
as open channels. Further analyses are needed to clarify
the precise kinetic properties of quinidine block of HERG
channel currents (e.g., Ridley et al., 2003; Arias et al.,
2003).

4.3. Conclusion

We have shown that quinidine inhibits HERG currents in
a voltage-dependent manner. Quinidine exhibited a very
rapid onset of block at positive membrane potentials.
Quinidine inhibited HERG currents in a frequency-indepen-
dent manner due to these rapid kinetic characteristics. In
contrast, dofetilide blocked HERG channels in a voltage-
independent manner. Dofetilide inhibited HERG currents in
a frequency-independent manner because of its slow
unblocking at negative potentials. It is difficult to directly
extrapolate the present results to the drug effect on native
cardiac IKr channels. Nevertheless, we consider that, with
distinct kinetic properties, quinidine and dofetilide might
cause a similar effect,
the reverse frequency-dependent
prolongation of action potential duration associated with
arrhythmia. Comparison of the kinetic properties of quini-
dine, dofetilide and vesnarinone suggest that the kinetic
properties of the agents may affect their effect on action
potential duration, and thus their clinical effects. Therefore,
it is important to identify the kinetic properties of HERG
channel blockers which do not prolong action potential
duration in a reverse frequency-dependent manner. Further
studies in this direction, combined with the analysis of the
three dimensional quantitative structure – activity relation-
ship of these agents (Ekins et al., 2002; Cavalli et al., 2002),
could lead to the development of effective IKr blockers
without proarrhythmic effects.
