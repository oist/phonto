The oscillatory insulin release is fundamental to normal glycemic control. The basis of the oscillation is the intercellular
coupling and bursting synchronization of b cells in each islet. The functional role of islet b cell mass organization with respect
to its oscillatory bursting is not well understood. This is of special interest in view of the recent finding of islet cytoarchitectural
differences between human and animal models. In this study we developed a new hexagonal closest packing (HCP) cell cluster
model. The model captures more accurately the real islet cell organization than the simple cubic packing (SCP) cluster that is
conventionally used. Using our new model we investigated the functional characteristics of b-cell clusters, including the
fraction of cells able to burst fb, the synchronization index l of the bursting b cells, the bursting period Tb, the plateau fraction
pf, and the amplitude of intracellular calcium oscillation [Ca]. We determined their dependence on cluster architectural
parameters including number of cells nb, number of inter-b cell couplings of each b cell nc, and the coupling strength gc. We
found that at low values of nb, nc and gc, the oscillation regularity improves with their increasing values. This functional gain
plateaus around their physiological values in real islets, at nb,100, nc,6 and gc,200 pS. In addition, normal b-cell clusters are
robust against significant perturbation to their architecture, including the presence of non-b cells or dead b cells. In clusters
with nb.,100, coordinated b-cell bursting can be maintained at up to 70% of b-cell loss, which is consistent with laboratory
and clinical findings of islets. Our results suggest that the bursting characteristics of a b-cell cluster depend quantitatively on
its architecture in a non-linear fashion. These findings are important to understand the islet bursting phenomenon and the
regulation of insulin secretion, under both physiological and pathological conditions.

INTRODUCTION
Insulin, secreted by pancreatic islet b cells,
is the principal
regulating hormone of glucose metabolism. Defects in insulin
release or its utilization lead to scores of metabolic disorders,
including diabetes.
insulin is
secreted in a pulsatile fashion, and the plasma insulin exhibits an
oscillatory pattern, both at basal and under stimulation [1,2].
Oscillatory insulin is critical to normal glycemic control; loss of
oscillation desensitizes the insulin receptors of target tissues and
contributes to insulin resistance [1,3,4]. This is a general feature of
endocrine glands to signal their remote target organs by pulsatile
rather than continuous hormone secretion in order to avoid down-
regulation of target tissue responses [5]. In patients with deficient
endogenous insulin secretion, pulsatile insulin delivery was proven
to be superior than continuous or bolus delivery [6–8]. The
importance of insulin pulsatility in glucose regulation is further
indicated by the loss of it observed in patients of both type 1
diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) [1,9], which together
constitute more than 95% of all diabetes cases. More interestingly,
the alterations in insulin oscillation have also been observed in
individuals at risk (first degree relatives) for both T1D [10] and
T2D [11,12], indicating its potential in developing early disease
markers. A quantitative understanding of the regulation of insulin
pulsatility is important to the understanding of glucose metabolic
control, and to diabetes research.

Insulin-secreting b cells, which comprise about 1% of the total
pancreatic cell populations, are not uniformly distributed across
the pancreas; rather they are organized in the islet of Langerhans.
Each human islet has ,103 cells, with the majority of them (,50–
70%) being b cells. This hierarchical organization of b-cell mass is
fundamental to their pulsatile insulin release, which is driven by
the electrical burst of the cell membrane. Although theoretically
single isolated b cells can burst, and can be induced in vitro to

release insulin under tightly controlled conditions, they respond
poorly to glucose and the bursting usually comprises erratic spiking
that is highly sensitive to noise [13–19]. In contrast, the insulin
release profile from b cells in intact islets is much more regular and
robust against noise [20–22]. Experimental data have demon-
strated that b cells within the same islet exhibit synchronous
oscillation [22–24],
leading to an appropriate glucose dose
response. Extensive mathematical modeling and computational
simulation of the islet oscillation has been carried out in the past
several decades [2,13–15,25–32]. Among the models that have
been proposed, the heterogeneity hypothesis is gaining acceptance
[15,27,32]. The pancreatic islet b cells are highly heterogeneous in
their biophysical properties including size, membrane capacitance,
channel density, and channel conductance, etc. This results in
diverse responses under the same condition, often with the
the b cells outside the narrow bursting regime.

and under-active b cells will cooperate through intercellular gap
junctional coupling, and together they are able to reach more
pronounced,
synchronized bursts. An alternative hypothesis,
proposed by the same group,
is the channel sharing theory
[13,26,33]. It postulates that the ionic current fluctuations arising
from channel-gating stochasticity can often disrupt the bursting
regularity from individual b cells. In a cluster such fluctuations are
largely neutralized through gap junctional coupling among b cells,
leading to coordinated bursting of the whole cluster. Later it was
found that even within the channel sharing hypothesis, heteroge-
neity is needed to produce regular bursting [34]. In this study we
will adopt the heterogeneity hypothesis.

Despite much works, a quantitative investigation of the islet
oscillation with respect to the cytoarchitectural organization of its
b-cell mass has not been performed. The islet is a highly organized
functional micro-organ with defined size and structure, intercel-
lular coupling, and autocrine and paracrine regulations. As the
pancreatic islet is not readily accessible in humans, in vivo study of
b-cell function primarily relies on animal models. However, recent
studies revealed architectural differences between human and
animal islets [35,36], and it is still not clear whether and how these
physical differences translate functionally.

In this study we investigate, for the first time, the role of islet
cytoarchitecture in the coordination of b-cell bursting. The
architectural parameters include the number of b cells in a cluster
nb, number of inter-b cell couplings of each b cell nc, and the
intercellular coupling strength gc. Within a b-cell cluster,
the
fraction of b cells (fb) that are able to establish regular bursting
patterns, and the degree of bursting synchronization (l) among
them, are clearly important to the insulin release function of the
cluster. The plateau fraction (pf), which is defined to be the relative
time spent in the active phase divided by the total burst interval
[37],
insulin
released is thought to be proportional to the plateau fraction [37].
Other parameters that have been speculated to be indicative of
function include the bursting period (Tb) and the amplitude of the
intracellular calcium oscillation ([Ca]) [14]. In this study we will
quantitatively evaluate these five functional measures and their
changes with varying values of nb, nc, and gc. To facilitate such
investigation, we introduce a new Hexagon Closest Packing (HCP)
cell cluster model for b cells in an islet. The HCP architecture is
significantly closer to a real islet than the Simple Cubic Packing
(SCP) scheme that has been conventionally utilized till now.

RESULTS
Development of the HCP b-cell cluster model
The HCP b-cell cluster The structural details of the HCP and
SCP lattices are given in the method section. To organize b cells in
a cluster, existing models till now utilized the SCP lattice, which
gives nc = 4 in 2D and nc = 6 in 3D. While examining the
architecture of
this protocol
significantly under-estimates nc. In addition, this does not give us
much room to investigate the functional consequence of
islet
architecture with varying nc values, or the consequence of non-
b cells or b-cell death. In this study we introduced the HCP lattice
to simulate b-cell clusters. This is based on the idea that a biological
cell can be approximated by a sphere, and spheres can be packed
more efficiently using HCP (the most compact packing for spheres)
than using SCP. In vitro experiments that studied clusters of b cells
also indicated that
lattice is a much better
approximation to the cluster structure [38,39]. With a HCP
cluster the number of intercellular couplings of each b cell is nc = 6
in 2D and nc = 12 in 3D. The arrangement of b cells in a HCP

is not as straightforward as in the case of a SCP cluster. We have
developed an algorithm, described in the method section, to carry
out this task in an automatic fashion. Figure 1 shows a HCP cluster
with edge size n = 4, and the cell numbering throughout its layers.

Synchronization of bursting cells We first compared the
fraction of burster cells fb and their synchronization index l for all
SCP (SCP-8, -27, -64, -125, -216, and -343) and HCP (HCP-13,
-57, -153 and -323) clusters we have simulated, at different gap
junctional coupling strength from gc = 25 pS to gc = 1000 pS. We
find that at or above normal physiological conditions of gc,150–
250 pS [14,40,41], the SCP and HCP clusters did not differ much
and all cluster sizes exhibited a high fraction (.99%) of well
synchronized burster cells (l.0.95). Figure 2 presents the results at
gc = 200 pS. It is known that under pathological conditions, the
intercellular coupling can be significantly impaired. For example,
chronic hyperglycemia can reduce the gap junctional conductance
between cells [42–45]. A particular case, when gc reduces to 50 pS,
is also plotted in figure 2 for both cluster types. Over 99% of the
b cells in HCP clusters are still able to burst, while this number
dropped significantly in the SCP clusters with the smaller ones
affected the most. Additionally, the synchronization among the
burster cells is also significantly less in the SCP clusters, especially
the smaller SCP clusters.

Under pathological conditions including diabetes, loss of b-cell
mass usually occur [46]. It can be a mere loss at peripheral that
affects only the value of islet size nb. More often, the b-cell loss
occurs across the islet, which affects the values of both nb and nc.
We have compared the two cluster types with varying percentages
of b cells randomly removed from the cluster. In figure 3, we
present results at normal and impaired gap junctional coupling gc.
At normal coupling strength of gc = 200 pS (left column), both
SCP and HCP are fairly robust against loss of b cells. With up to
50% of b cells lost, over 90% of the remaining cells in the clusters
are still able to burst with significant synchronization of l.0.7.

A close look of the figure reveals that the HCP clusters are more
robust than SCP ones, especially when b-cell loss is over 50%.
This difference is more pronounced and can be observed sooner
when the gap junctional coupling is impaired. Specifically at
gc = 50 pS (figure 3, middle column), a HCP cluster can tolerate
more than 50% of b-cell loss, while 30% b-cell loss will completely

disrupt
gc = 25 pS (figure 3, right column), even with 50% b-cell
loss,
the majority of remaining cells in the HCP clusters are still able to
burst synchronously, whilst the SCP clusters would not endure any
b-cell loss (with the exception of SCP-343, at #10% b-cell loss).
Other functional parameters We have also compared the
HCP and SCP clusters in terms of the other three functional
measures: bursting period Tb, plateau fraction pf, and calcium
amplitude [Ca]. We found that under normal conditions, HCP b-
cell clusters burst with significantly longer period (figure 4). This is
true even when the cell cluster is under significant perturbation,
with impaired intercellular coupling as low as gc = 50 pS and b-cell
damage up to 50%. When we examined pf and [Ca], we did not
see significant difference between the two types of clusters, either
at normal or under compromised cluster architectural parameter
values (data not shown).

architectural parameters (nb, nc and gc), using our HCP model of b-
cell cluster. In real human islets, there are significant amounts of non-
b cells (up to 30–50%), which do not couple or synchronize with
b cells. Studies that profiled Ca2+
concentration within intact islets
found that the oscillation in non-b cells were completely asynchro-
nous, both with respect to each other and to b cells [23]. We there-
fore carried out our investigation with 30–50% of the cells randomly
removed from coupling with the rest of the cells in the cluster.

Size of a b-cell cluster nb Under normal coupling strength
,150–250 pS [41], no significant
functional dependence on
cluster size nb has been observed for b-cell clusters with more
than ,100 cells. Figure 5 (left and middle columns) depicts
simulation results at
the 5
functional measures showed notable dependence on cluster size
nb. We then examined if
larger clusters have a functional
advantage when the intercellular coupling or functional b-cell
mass is compromised. We found that advantage of larger clusters is
only notable under extreme pathological conditions. In the same
figure, we also included results at gc = 50 pS, and when there is
70% loss of b cells (right column). Moderate functional gain with
increasing nb, primarily in terms of improved fb and l, is observed.

Results of the SCP clusters, also included in figure 5, indicate the
same conclusion.

The benefit of increasing nb is most notable for very small
clusters with nb,100. In the previous section where we compared
the SCP and HCP clusters, smaller clusters with less than 100
b cells
(SCP-8, SCP-64, HCP-13 and HCP-57) were also
simulated (figure 2). These results also indicated little dependence
on cluster size. Only when coupling is impaired, there is moderate
functional gain with increasing cluster size (dashed lines in figure 2).
Number of intercellular couplings per b cell nc As we
have pointed out earlier non-b cells in real human islets likely do
not couple or synchronize with b cells [23]. Their presence will
make the effective nc value less than the number of the nearest
neighbors each b cells has (as not all of them are b cells). 30% non-
b cells translates to an effective nc = 8.4 in our HCP model, and
50% non-b cells means nc = 6. Pathological loss of b-cell mass can
also lead to reduced nc. Therefore it is of interest to determine the
functional role of nc.

Intuitively one would expect that more intercellular coupling is
desirable for the heterogeneous b-cell population in order to
coordinate and synchronize their bursting and insulin release. We

have found that this is indeed the case. Figure 6 gives the results of
the 5 bursting measures for a HCP-323 b-cell cluster at normal
and impaired coupling strength of gc = 200 pS and gc = 25 pS,
respectively. We have also included in the figure, results for
a cluster of totally uncoupled b cells (nc = 0 or gc = 0, dashed lines).
The results of the two synchronization measures, fb and l, are
particularly revealing. Under normal conditions each b-cell on
average needs to be coupled to at least 3 other b cells (nc.2.4), in
order to reach synchronized bursting of the cluster. The bursting
coordination improves with increasing value of nc. However, this
improvement plateaus at around nc = 6, a value that is about half
of its up-limit in a HCP cluster. The simulation results for other
clusters with more than 100 b cells (HCP-153 and SCP125, -216,
-343) are quantitatively similar (data not shown). Interestingly
the amount of b-cell couplings in a normal HCP b-cell cluster with
30–50% of non-b cells (as human islets do) is nc,6–8.4. This gives
the b-cell cluster some room to tolerate perturbation to its
architecture, namely, a small amount of random b-cell loss will not
lead to significant alteration of the cluster function. When the gap
junctional coupling is impaired, it takes much higher values of nc to
reach a good bursting synchronization among b cells. At gc = 25 pS,
a ,10 fold reduction from the normal strength, synchronized
bursting can only be achieved with nc.6. These results demonstrate
that a b-cell cluster with a higher-nc architecture will be more robust
against pathological perturbations.

strength gc The

intercellular
coupling strength is known to be a critical parameter for normal
islet
Impaired gap junctional coupling
between b cells will compromise their glucose sensitivity and
insulin release functionality [48,49]. We have simulated b-cell
clusters at varying coupling strength from 25 pS to 1000 pS. We
find that at low values below the normal physiological range of
increased gc generally leads to higher fb and l. Figure 7 presents
the results at both 30% and 50% of non-b cells. Evidently, the
functional gain in fb and l plateaus around ,200 pS.

The other three functional measures including Tb, pf and [Ca]
also showed dependence on gc, though the interpretation is less

obvious. The relationship is not always monotonic (figure 7).
Specifically, the calcium amplitude profile exhibited an initial rise
with increasing value of gc, it then peaked around a value within
the normal physiological range of gc and then drops afterwards.
This phenomenon has also been observed by others [14]. In general
there has not been enough study or a priori knowledge of these three
parameters to presume what values are functionally desirable. Of
interest is the fact that when gc is beyond the normal physiological
value range (gc.,250 pS), dependence on gc is much less marked
for all parameters and even diminishing for some.

Loss of b-cell mass During the disease progression for all
major forms of diabetes loss of b-cell mass has been observed [46].
The alteration sometimes could be merely a reduction in islet size
nb, but more often more profound changes
to the islet
cytoarchitecture occur. For example,
in type 1 diabetes the
infiltrating immune cells spread from peripheral islet vessels to the
centre of a given islet, causing b-cell apoptosis across the islet
[50,51]. In this situation both nb and nc are reduced, more
significantly so for nc. For this reason we have examined the
impact to the cluster bursting pattern when there is random b-cell
loss across the cluster. Both fb and l fall with increasing loss of
b cells (data not shown). The results are similar to that presented in
figure 3, where we compared the SCP and HCP cluster at 0% of
non-b cells. We are specifically interested in the threshold loss of b-
cell mass that would lead to functional failure. As the coordination
and synchronization of
is
fundamental to regulated, glucose dose-dependent insulin release,
we investigated this problem from the perspective of b-cell
bursting synchronization. We first simulated and determined the
degree of synchronization that would be expected by chance for
a cluster of uncoupled b cells. We then assumed that a b-cell
cluster would not be able to function normally if its l falls below 2
SD of this basal level. Using this criterion, we investigated the
threshold loss of b-cell mass that would result in functional failure,
under varying values of gc. Around physiological values of gc (150–
250 pS), at 30% non-b cells, we found that HCP b-cell clusters can
function with majority, up to 70%, of its b-cell mass lost. The

Figure 3. The HCP clusters are more robust against perturbations to its architecture than the SCP clusters. At normal coupling strength of
gc = 200 pS (left columns), both cluster types are robust against up to 50% b-cell loss in the cluster. When the coupling is compromised with reduced
gc values (middle and right columns), the SCP clusters are more affected by b-cell loss. Dashed lines are the mean and the 2 standard deviations (SD)
of completely uncoupled b cells.

result of gc = 200 pS is given in figure 8. This is consistent with the
laboratory and clinical findings. Laboratory studies have shown
that islets are tolerant of substantial b-cell loss, and can function
normally with majority of b cells either dead or non-functioning
[48]. Clinically it is believed that in type 1 diabetes disease onset
occurs with up to 70–90% of b cells are destroyed [52]. In
the
contrast,
the SCP clusters do not have such robustness,
threshold loss is only 40% at gc = 200 pS (figure 8). If
the
intercellular coupling is impaired with a low gc value, the function
of the b-cell cluster is much less robust against b-cell damages. At
gc,25 pS, a 30% of b-cell
loss would completely disrupt the
bursting coordination of a HCP b-cell cluster.

DISCUSSION
In this first effort to quantitatively investigate the role of islet
cytoarchitecture with respect to its pulsatile bursting, we examined
three structural parameters of b-cell clusters: cluster size nb, the
number of intercellular couplings each b cell has nc, and the

investigation of

intercellular coupling strength gc. To enable a more realistic
mathematical
islet architecture, we introduced
a new b-cell packing model, based on the HCP lattice structure, to
replace the SCP model that is conventionally used. The HCP
cluster is a much closer approximation of the b-cell arrangement
in real islets [38,39], and more accurately captures the degree of
intercellular coupling nc. We found that the HCP b-cell clusters
are functionally more desirable than the SCP clusters, as
evidenced from the higher fractions of burster cells (fb), better
synchronization (l), and longer bursting periods (Tb). In addition,
the HCP clusters are significantly more robust against architec-
including presence of non-b cells, b-cell
tural perturbations,
damage and impaired gap junctional couplings. Further,
the
proposed HCP architecture is able to explain why islets can
function with majority of b cells lost. In contrast, the SCP model
would require majority of its b cells to be intact for the b-cell
cluster to burst regularly. Therefore we believe that the HCP
model is a better one to study the islet bursting phenomenon. In

this study, we utilized our HCP model to investigate quantitatively
the dependence of islet bursting on its architecture. We have found
that the functional measures, including fb, l, Tb, pf, and [Ca],
depend exquisitely on the three architectural parameters nb, nc and
gc. As the ability to reach synchronized bursting is fundamental to
the regulation of islet insulin release, and its role in islet function is
much better understood than the other three parameters (Tb, pf,
[Ca]), our investigation focused more on the evaluation of fb and l.

Is there an optimal islet size?
When judged by the fraction of burster b cells fb and the degree of
their synchronization l, our simulation results suggest that the very
small b-cell clusters (nb,50) are not functionally stable (figure 2,
large standard deviations). They are also very sensitive to
structural perturbations including b-cell damage and intercellular
coupling impairment. When the size increases, initially there is
functional gain with increasing cluster size (figure 2). This is
manifested in improved fb and l values, and robustness against b-
cell death. However the functional gain plateaus when the b-cell
number reaches above ,100–200 cells (figure 5), suggesting that
very large b-cell clusters are not necessarily more desirable.

In reality the islet size is also limited by other factors. In our
present modeling and simulation, we did not consider the non-
uniform distribution of external stimuli such as the intra-islet
glucose concentration. In rodent islets, it is believed the blood
vessel goes to the center of the islet and blood flows from the center
out. The architecture and microcirculation of human islets are
believed to be more complex [35,36], and may contain several
sub-compartments of b-cell clusters organized around the micro
vascularization within the islet. This would lead to more
complicated pattern of non-uniformity in intra-islet glucose
concentration, serving as a confounding factor on top of the
heterogeneous biophysical properties of b cells. In vitro studies
have demonstrated that such a glucose gradient can result in an
attenuating propagation wave of intra-islet calcium, resulting in
the inactivity of b cells that are far from the center. Several other
problems that may be a concern in large islets include the oxygen

supply, the microvascular circulation that are needed to support
cell metabolism, and the paracrine relationship between cells, etc.
In vitro functional studies of both human and animal islets have
revealed that larger islets are less efficient at insulin release than
smaller islets under basal and stimulatory glucose levels [53,54]. In
the work by Lehmann et al [54], human islets were separated into
two groups according to their diameter: small islets, 50–150 um;
and large islets, 150–300 um. When normalized with islet volume
(termed IEQ,
islet equivalent), basal and stimulated insulin
secretion was twice as high in small islets compared with large
islets. Similar findings were observed in [53] for rat islets. In these
studies, the large islets contain ,103 cells and the small islets ,102
cells. These studies also examined the transplantation outcome
and clear superiority of the small islet group was observed [53,54].
These indicate that there could be a functional compromise when
the islet size gets too big in vivo.

Mammalian species span several orders of magnitude in terms
of body weight, with commensurate demand on insulin and hence
total endocrine pancreatic mass. Interestingly,
the increased
endocrine mass in larger mammals is manifested in the form of
increased number of islets, rather than significantly larger islets.
For example, the body weight of an average human being is
around 1,000 fold of rodents, and the total endocrine b-cell mass is
roughly in the same proportion. On average, humans have ,106
islets, whilst rodents ,103, a 1,000 fold difference. In contrast their
islet sizes are within the same order of magnitude at ,102–103.
This phenomenon also indicates a possible functional optimal
range for islet size at nb,102–103, and different species may have
all arrived at values within this range through evolution.

It is known that under certain physiological or pathological
conditions, such as during pregnancy and obesity, expansion of
islet size (nb) has been observed [46]. It is still not clear if the
expansion, assumed to have occurred in order to compensate for
the increased demand, is really able to adequately address the
need, and if it has played a role in the increased risk for diabetes

Figure 5. Function of a b-cell cluster versus its size nb. Left and middle columns: at normal coupling strength and no loss of b cells, no significant
dependence is observed in the HCP b-cell clusters (solid lines). This is true even when the intercellular coupling is impaired to a very low value of
25 pS. Right column: when there is extensive b-cell loss at 70%, marginal functional gain is observed in fb and [Ca].

The importance of team work

In a real islet the effective number of inter-b cell coupling nc that each
b cell has is less than the number of its nearest neighbors. Further the
value nc is readily influenced by physiological or pathological
changes such as presence of non-b cells, or b-cell damage. In this
study, the role of nc in islet function was, for the first time, quantitatively
investigated. We

found that at normal

The investigation of nc as an islet architectural parameter is also
important to translational research. Much of our past understand-
ing of
islet function and structure was obtained from rodent
models, where most b cells are clustered around a center core,
surrounded by a layer of a and d cells. Recent studies have

revealed a cytoarchitectural difference between human and rodent
islets [35,36]. It was found that human islets on average contained
proportionally fewer b cells, ,55% versus 70–80% in rodents
[35,36]. In addition, throughout human islets b cells are more
intermingled with the other islet cell types (mainly a and d cells). It
was estimated that about 70% of the b cells exclusively associate
with b cells in rodent islets (corresponding to a nc,8.4 HCP
cluster), whilst in human islets, this number can be as low as 30%
[35,36] (nc,3.6). These reports suggest that rodent islets may have
much higher nc than human ones. It might still be arguable if the
apparent cytoarchitectural difference is fundamental to function.
Concerns that have been raised include the fact that human islets
were usually obtained under different pathological conditions, and
that human islets may be of a composite compartmental structure
with each compartment organized in the same architectural
principle of a single rodent islet (private communication with
experts in the field). Measurements with human islets did show

subregions of b cells synchronization, but not across the whole islet
[55]. More studies are obviously needed to settle these issues.
However, we would like to point out
that a quantitative
investigation of islet function versus its structural parameters will
provide insights to the cytoarchitectural organization principle of
b-cell mass, and whether there are fundamental differences across
different
species. Understanding these issues will be highly
valuable to translational studies using animal islets.

The strength of bond
The strength of the intercellular coupling is another important islet
architectural parameter. Inhibition of gap junctions led to loss of
glucose sensitivity in intact rodent islets [48]. In this study our
simulation results suggest that there is an optimal value range for
function around 100–200 pS, beyond which there is
little
functional gain with increasing values of gc. Similar results have
been previously observed by others in their simulation studies of
islet oscillation [14]. This range is around the values observed in
normal rodent islets (213+/2113 pS) [41]. Very few human islet
measurements are available at this time.

The intercellular couplings are mediated through channels located
at gap junctions. Gap junctions are specific membrane structures
consisting of aggregates of intercellular channels that enable the
direct exchange of ions and small metabolites (,1 kD) [56]. Such
intercellular channels result from the association of two hemichan-
nels, named connexons, which are separately contributed by two
adjacent cells. Each connexon is an assembly of six transmembrane
connexins, encoded by a family of genes with more than 20
members. The coupling strength depends on the number of gap
junctions, as well as the number and the physiological state of their
constituting subunit connexons. Extra energy (to make connexons) is
required to increase the value of gc. It is therefore not surprising that
normal islets function at a gc value beyond which little functional gain
can be achieved. Further it has been found that glycemic condition
directly affects the transcription level of connexins [42] and hence the
value of gc. Diabetes therapeutic drugs that were designed to target at
intercellular cAMP levels or KATP channels, are often found to also
modulate the value of gc [57]. These all indicate the importance of
the b-cell gap junctional coupling in normal islet function, and more
work is needed in this area.

Pathological alterations to b-cell mass and islet
morphology
Under pathological conditions of glycemic control, alterations to b-
cell mass usually occur. Another important finding of our study is the
fact that alterations (especially loss) to b-cell mass can affect only nb (a
mere islet size growth or b-cell death at islet peripheral, for example),
or both nb and nc (b-cell death across the whole islet, for example),
which are independent cytoarchitectural parameters that are both
important to function. Though different types of mass changes may
result in the same total b-cell mass, they could nonetheless lead to
distinct bursting characteristics alterations. Our simulation results
indicate that a reduction in nb that also affects nc will modify the islet
function more markedly than a reduction only in nb (figures 5–6). To
investigate the b-cell mass alterations and the consequent compro-
mise in b-cell function, we therefore must first determine whether
only nb, or both nb and nc are affected.

During the prediabetic development of

type 2 diabetes,
a transient expansion of islet size (nbq) is often observed before
b-cell mass reduction ensues [46]. Whether and how the transient
change contributes to disease pathogenesis is not yet understood.
During the development of type 1 diabetes, b-cell mass is gradually
destroyed by infiltrating immune-cells [52], which results in
a gradual reduction in both nb and nc for each islet. These specific
characteristics in b-cell mass alteration need to be considered and
differentiated when investigating each pathological condition.

A quantitative understanding of
cytoarchitecture is much needed, but has not been investigated

Our study represents a very first step toward this goal. Much
work is still needed. In an intact islet there are other islet cell types,
and numerous paracrine, hormonal, and nervous signals that fine-
tune the insulin secretion under different physiological conditions.
The non-b cell types secrete a few other types of hormones
the hormones, glucagon and
additional
somatostatin are clearly involved in the regulation of
insulin
secretion [59]. To fully understand the phenomenon of plasma
insulin pulsatility, several additional levels of regulation also need
to be investigated, which include but not limited to: the coupling of
the b cell membrane electrical burst with glycolysis oscillation [60],
and the inter-islet coordination and possible existence of a pace-
making mechanism provided by the central nerves system (CNS)
[61] or the intrapancreatic ganglia [62]. Our study reported here
serve as a basis for these future works.

METHODS
Mathematical model of the electrical excitability of
individual b cells
Pancreatic islet b cells are electrically excitable cells. At basal level
of glucose cell membranes are hyperpolarized with a resting

to more positive values;

channels; the influx of Ca2+

potential around 270 mV [63,64]. In presence of elevated plasma
glucose concentration, the glucose metabolism at mitochondria
results in net generation of ATP; the increased ATP:ADP ratio will
close the ATP-dependent KATP channels, which will drive the
membrane potential
the membrane
depolarization will trigger action potential firing and opening of
the voltage-dependent Ca2+
will raise its
intracellular concentration from a basal of 0.05–0.1 mM to
stimulatory values .0.15–0.2 mM that will trigger exocytosis of
membrane-docked insulin granules [65,66]. During this process,
+
voltage–dependent K
channels will open in response to membrane
+
depolarization, and will mediate outwardly rectifying K
current that
serves to re-polarize cell membrane [65,67]. Consequently, the
electrical potential across b-cell membrane oscillates between
depolarized plateaus, on which bursts of action potentials are
superimposed, separated by repolarized electrically silent intervals.
The bursting oscillations of membrane action potential give rise to
oscillations in the intracellular calcium concentration and in the
secretion of
insulin into blood stream. The duration and the
periodicity of the bursts depend on glucose concentration. The rate
of insulin release is believed to be roughly proportional to the
‘‘plateau fraction’’, which is defined to be the relative time spent in
the active phase divided by the total burst interval [37].

Mathematically, b-cell electrical oscillation can be explained by
the Hodgkin-Huxley theory of ion channel gating [68], with cell
membrane electrical potential V described by a ordinary differ-
ential equation (essentially the Kirchhoff’s voltage law of a RC

circuit): Cm

total membrane area, therefore the distribution of Cm is computed
from the distribution of cell radii. The heterogeneity in membrane
conductance results from variations in channel density. Our
approach is similar to the method outlined in [15].

The HCP model of b-cell cluster
In this study we introduced the HCP lattice to simulate b-cell
clusters. In figure 9 we lay out the HCP structure in contrast to the
SCP lattice that is conventionally used. In 2D HCP nc = 6, a value
1.5 fold higher than in SCP. The difference is more significant in the
real 3D situation, with nc = 12 in HCP, 2 fold higher than in SCP.
The number of cells in a 2D regular HCP cluster with edge size n is
given by NHCP(n) = 3n223n+1, and in a 3D HCP it is given by:

Table 3 compares the number of cells that can be packed into
cubic and hexagonal lattices for a range of edge sizes n. To arrange
b cells in an HCP cluster and setup their equations 1–5 for
simulation, we have developed a cell
labeling algorithm. The
flowchart is presented in figure 10. Given a b-cell cluster size nb,
the program will
first decide according to equation 6 the
maximum edge size n of the HCP lattice that these cells can fill
up, while extra cells (nb2NHCP(n)) will be attached outside the
complete HCP lattice in a random fashion. Labeling of the cells
will start with the center layer, which we call the primary layer
(figure 1). It is a 2D regular hexagon of edge size n, with a total of
3n223n+1 cells. The remaining n21 layers on each side (top and
bottom) of
the primary layer, starting from immediate layer
adjacent to it, alternate between being a layer that is of irregular
hexagonal shape (which we call IH layer), and being a layer that is
of regular hexagonal shape (which we call RH layer). When n is an
even number, i.e., n = 2k where k is an integer, the HCP cluster
ends with a IH-layer on its surface; when n is an odd number, i.e.,
n = 2k+1 where k is an integer, the HCP ends with an RH-layer on
its surface. The edge size decreases by 1 each time when traversing
up or down. The number of cells in a IH layer is given by 3(n21)2,
and the number of cells in a RH layer is given by 3n223n+1,
where n is the edge size of that layer. Lastly, the program will
label for each cell their nearest neighbors throughout the layers.

Simulation details
The simulation of equations 1–5 is performed in MATLAB at time
step Dt = 1 ms by Euler integration, which turns out to be small
enough. Simulations at smaller time steps with 0.5 and 0.2 ms were
also performed for extreme conditions (the high end values of gc =
1000 pS and gc = 500 pS), and randomly chosen cases through out
our parameter spectrum, to ensure this choice of time step. Cluster
size ranged from SCP-8 and HCP-13 to SCP-343 and HCP-323
respectively. The gc value ranged from 25 pS to 1000 pS. For each
condition, 10 replicate clusters were simulated, with cells randomly
generated according to parameter values listed in tables 1 and 2.

In general a b cell can be a burster cell, a spiker cell, or a silent cell.
A burster cell is defined as a cell capable of producing a sequence of
well-defined regular bursts which correlate with the period between
the consecutive peaks and nadirs. In figure 11 we present the action
potential and s(t) for the three types of cells respectively. Post
simulation of a b-cell cluster, the oscillatory status of each b cell was
first determined. Due to the scale of our simulation, this was carried
out in an automatic fashion using a program that we wrote. The
program first identifies the silent cells, defined to be those whose
maximum and minimum membrane voltages differ less than 30 mV.
For the remaining cells (which are a mixture of bursters and spikers),
the peaks and nadirs of all state variables are determined by
a recursive difference algorithm which extracts the peak and nadir
points based on gradient change. In this study, the nadir and peak
information of the s(t) data were used to distinguish between spikers
and bursters (figure 11). Specifically, if the mean amplitude of s
oscillation (peak-nadir) exceeds a threshold value, 15 percentile value
of the maximum amplitude observed in random un-coupled b cells,
the cell is considered a burster. This threshold value was determined
empirically, and the algorithm has been evaluated and optimized
manually using extensive simulation results.

For burster b cells, their bursting periods Tb, plateau fraction pf,
calcium amplitude [Ca], as well as degree of synchronization in
bursting l (see the next subsection) were then determined. Mean
and standard deviation (SD) were also obtained for each group of
10 replicated clusters.

For clusters with nb.100 (SCP-125, -216, -343, HCP-153, -323),
we have also determined the bursting properties with varying
percentages (10–90%) of b cells randomly (not from peripheral) removed
across the cluster. This way both nb and nc are modified, and it allows
the investigation of the presence of non-b islet cells, and the loss of b-
cell mass under pathological conditions. In addition to coupled b-cell
clusters, 500 single b cells with the same degree of heterogeneity were
simulated to provide baseline information.

Phase synchronization analysis of bursting b cells
Laboratory measurements have established that the oscillations
are nearly synchronous among the b cells within an intact islet,
and this is believed to be important for its insulin release regulation
[23]. In this study, we evaluate b-cell bursting synchronization
within a cluster through phase synchronization analysis. It is
a technique to infer interaction from the coordination and phase
locking of two time series, based on analytical signal concepts
[72,73]. Compared with more traditional techniques (correlation
coefficient, for example), it has the advantage of being more robust
to the variation in oscillation amplitude that can mask the phase
locking, and more sensitive to the inter-coordination between
systems. Recently this technique was applied to the analysis of
bursting synchronization between two b cells [74].

Our phase synchronization analysis of b-cell clusters was
implemented in Matlab. Briefly, for each b cell j the instantaneous
phase Qj(t) of the membrane action potential was determined
