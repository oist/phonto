Basic cellular and network mechanisms underlying gamma fre-
quency oscillations (30 – 80 Hz) have been well characterized in the
hippocampus and associated structures. In these regions, gamma
rhythms are seen as an emergent property of networks of principal
cells and fast-spiking interneurons. In contrast, in the neocortex a
number of elegant studies have shown that speciﬁc types of
principal neuron exist that are capable of generating powerful
gamma frequency outputs on the basis of their intrinsic conduc-
tances alone. These fast rhythmic bursting (FRB) neurons (some-
times referred to as ‘‘chattering’’ cells) are activated by sensory
stimuli and generate multiple action potentials per gamma period.
Here, we demonstrate that FRB neurons may function by providing
a large-scale input to an axon plexus consisting of gap-junctionally
connected axons from both FRB neurons and their anatomically
similar counterparts regular spiking neurons. The resulting net-
work gamma oscillation shares all of the properties of gamma
oscillations generated in the hippocampus but with the additional
critical dependence on multiple spiking in FRB cells.

Gamma frequency oscillations are readily recordable from

scalp and depth electroencephalogram electrodes placed
over or in the neocortex of humans and laboratory animals. They
occur spontaneously at low amplitude or transiently at larger
amplitudes in response to sensory stimuli (1, 2). Their role in
processing of sensory information has been proposed to involve
the establishment of a temporal framework within which long-
range synchronization of individual neuronal elements coding
for specific sensory events can occur (3). Qualitatively similar
oscillations also occur in the hippocampus (4) and entorhinal
cortex (5), where their generation can be ascribed to the phasic
or tonic (or a combination of both) excitation of fast spiking (FS)
interneurons, the outputs of which, in turn, provide a temporal
framework for controlling the outputs of principal cells (6, 7).
Although much is known of the mechanisms underlying
gamma oscillations in the archicortex and entorhinal cortex,
relatively little evidence is available to suggest a mechanism (or
mechanisms) involved in generating neocortical gamma oscilla-
tions. What is known is that specific neurons exist within the
neocortical mantle that are capable of generating outputs within
the gamma frequency range on the basis of intrinsic properties
alone (in the absence of influences from local networks). Such
neurons exhibit fast rhythmic bursting (FRB), with interburst
frequencies of 20 Hz and upward, in response to depolarizing
current injection alone (8–10). These FRB neurons (sometimes
called ‘‘chattering cells’’) have also been shown to participate in
visually evoked gamma (25–70 Hz) oscillations in vivo (8), with
the FRB cells morphologically identified as spiny layer II兾III
pyramidal neurons. Other principal neocortical neurons also
possess the ability to generate activity within the gamma band on
the basis of intrinsic properties alone in layer IV (11), and some
interneurons also demonstrate this ability (9).

A number of similar types of interneuron exist in neo- and
archicortex, and phenomena associated with gap junctional
activity within principal cell networks has been shown in neo-

cortex (12, 13). It therefore appears that all of the components
shown to be important in generating archicortical gamma also
exist in neocortex alongside the above intrinsic gamma genera-
tors. Here, we used an experimental in vitro model of cortical
gamma oscillations and network simulations to investigate how
FRB neurons could contribute mechanistically to gamma oscil-
lations. Specifically, we investigated whether these neurons were
necessary for neocortical gamma oscillations and how they would
interact with phylogenetically older network mechanisms of
gamma rhythmogenesis.

Methods
Slice Methods. Horizontal 450-␮m-thick slices were prepared
from adult male Wistar rats (150–250 g). Neocortical slices
containing primary and secondary auditory areas and secondary
parietal areas were maintained at 34°C at the interface between
warm wetted 95% O2兾5% CO2 and artificial cerebrospinal fluid
containing (in mM): 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 1 MgSO4, 1.2 CaCl2,
24 NaHCO3, 10 glucose, and 126 NaCl. Extracellular recordings
from primary auditory cortex were obtained by using glass
micropipettes containing the above artificial cerebrospinal fluid
(resistance ⬍0.5 M⍀). Intracellular recordings were taken with
sharp microelectrodes filled with potassium acetate (resistance
30–90 M⍀). Signals were analogue filtered at 2 kHz and digitized
at 10 kHz. All neuronal recordings illustrated were taken from
layer III (including layer II兾III and layer III兾IV borders).

Simulation Methods. The network model contains 1,152 pyramidal
cells, 192 FS (fast-spiking) interneurons, and 96 LTS (low-
threshold spiking) interneurons. The proportions of pyramidal
cells which were RS (regular spiking), or FRB were varied
between simulations. RS and FS cells did not have any intrinsic
capability of generating gamma frequency outputs. There are
chemical synaptic interactions mediated by ␣-amino-3-hydroxy-
5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)兾kainate receptors
and ␥-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors, as well as
electrical coupling between the axons of some of the pyramidal
cells and the dendrites of some of the interneurons. Half of the
FS interneurons are basket cells, synaptically contacting the
soma and proximal dendrites of pyramidal cells; the other half
of the FS interneurons are axoaxonic (chandelier) cells, con-
tacting the most proximal axon of pyramidal cells, and not
synaptically contacting any interneurons. Connections, both
synaptic and electrical, were formed randomly, so far as the
identity of cells was concerned; that is, the spatial location of cell

constraints as to where on each neuron particular sorts of
connections were allowed to form. Further simulation details
can be found in Supporting Text, further information on prop-
erties of pyramidial cells can be found in Fig. 5, characteristics
of interneurons can be found in Fig. 6 and Table 1, which are

InSituHybridization Methods. Adult female rats were anesthetized
and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer
(pH 7.4). Brains were removed and postfixed overnight at 4°C
before 50-␮m-thick sections were cut. In situ hybridization was
performed by using sense (control) and antisense RNAs for Px2.
DNA templates for px2 spanned the entire ORF (14) and were
cloned into pBluescript SK⫺. For riboprobe synthesis, the
recombinant plasmids were linearized and in vitro transcription
was performed with T3(sense) and T7(antisense) polymerase.
Riboprobes were purified by using miniquick-spin RNA columns
(Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and stored at ⫺70°C.
In situ hybridization was performed as described in ref 15.

Results
We produced persistent field potential gamma oscillations in rat
auditory cortex slices, in an interface slice preparation, by adding
400 nM kainate to the bathing medium (Fig. 1A). Power spectra,
obtained through different layers in the cortex, indicated that the
maximum gamma power occurred approximately in layer III.
The oscillations persisted for hours, as has been reported for
other in vitro preparations, including carbachol兾kainate oscilla-
tions in cortex (16), carbachol oscillations in hippocampus (17),
and kainate oscillations in hippocampus (18, 19). For persistent
hippocampal oscillations, driven by kainate application, the
rhythm appears to be generated as a consequence of a large
increase in ectopic spike generation within an axon plexus. These
spikes drive large compound, phasic, AMPA receptor-mediated
excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) to FS interneurons
which, in turn, feed back onto principal cells to modulate axonal
activity (19).
To analyze in vitro cortical gamma oscillations, we constructed
a network simulation model of layers II兾III, by using four types
of multicompartment neurons: RS and FRB pyramidal cells
(modeled as in ref. 20, with 1,152 pyramidal neurons in all,
having a variable proportion of FRB cells); 192 FS interneurons,
divided between basket cells and axoaxonic cells; and 96 LTS
interneurons, which contacted dendrites of other cells. FRB cells
were distinguished from RS cells by being more depolarized,
having greater persistent gNa density, and fewer BK channels
(20). The cells were interconnected synaptically, through AMPA
and GABAA receptors, and by means of electrical coupling.
Electrical coupling occurred between the axons of principal cells,
as in our models of hippocampal persistent gamma (21); between
the dendrites of FS cells; and between the dendrites of LTS cells
(22–25). Further structural details are in Supporting Text. The
network generated gamma oscillations in the presence of a low
frequency (1 Hz per axon) of ectopic spikes in pyramidal cell
axons (26). In control simulations, 5% of pyramidal cells were
FRB. In ‘‘wiring’’ the model, both for synaptic and also electrical
connections, no distinction was made in the simulation program
between RS and FRB cells.

The network model and cortical slice oscillations shared a
qualitatively similar ‘‘pharmacology.’’ In the model, blocking
electrical coupling, or AMPA receptors, or GABAA receptors,
all reduced peak gamma power 500-fold, while prolonging
GABAA decay time constant 2-fold reduced the peak frequency
from 34.8 to 26.9 Hz. Experimentally, the gap-junction blocker
carbenoxolone (0.1 mM) reduced gamma power (from layer III)
2.4-fold (control 6.4 ⫾ 2.7 nV2 Hz, carbenoxolone 2.6 ⫾ 1.3 nV2

Firing patterns of the various cell types, presumably recorded
in the soma, were also strikingly similar, comparing model with
experiment (Fig. 1B). FS cells fired on the highest proportion of

field gamma periods (28.5 Hz average firing rate in two model
FS cells, overall model oscillation frequency 34.8 Hz), whereas
LTS firing was sparser (15.5 Hz average firing rate in two model
LTS cells). FRB cells either skipped periods, or fired a spike
singlet, doublet, or triplet; in the model, two FRB cells fired a
spike or a doublet at 17 Hz, i.e., on 50% of the waves. RS cells
fired sparsely (8.8 Hz average rate in 12 model cells), but with
clear subthreshold gamma oscillation consisting of synaptic

Fig. 2. RS cells ﬁre sporadically but exhibit evidence of axonal activity, whereas FRB cells are predicted to help generate the gamma oscillation. (A) In both model
and experiment, RS cells would on occasion exhibit spikelets at resting membrane potential during the oscillation (asterisks), having the appearance of miniature
action potentials, and corresponding in the model to decrementally conducted antidromic spikes. Depolarization of RS cells to more than ⫺50 mV abolished full
somatic spikes but left spikelets intact (lower trace). (Inset) Shown are superimposed averages (n ⫽ 10) of RS cell spikelets and EPSPs to demonstrate differences
in kinetics. Spikelets were not observed in FRB cells in either this model or experiment. Scale bars: 10 mV (model), 5 mV (experiment), and 100 ms (Inset 40 ms).
(B) In contrast, the model predicts that FRB cells contribute to pacing the gamma rhythm. Gamma power rises as the percentage of FRB cells increases, with a
threshold at ⬇4% and leveling off of the power between ⬇8% and 15% FRB cells. In these simulations, oscillation frequency ranged from 30.0 to 37.0 Hz, and
was not correlated with the percent of FRB cells (r2 ⫽ 0.24). (C) Evidence for a substrate for the sensitivity of the oscillation to gap-junction blockers has as yet
to be found. However, mRNA for the gap-junction forming pannexin Px2 are present on neurons in auditory cortex. Shown are mRNA expression for Px2 by using
nonradioactive in situ hybridization at low magniﬁcation (Upper: scale bar, 0.2 mm) and high magniﬁcation in LII-VI (Lower: scale bar, 10 ␮m).

Phenytoin blocks kainate-induced gamma oscillations in auditory cortex, but not in hippocampus, in vitro. (A) Field potential recordings (1-s epoch) of
persistent gamma oscillations in the hippocampal CA3 stratum radiatum subﬁeld (Left) and auditory cortical layer III (Right) are shown before (con) and after
(phenytoin) bath application of 50 ␮M phenytoin. Scale bars: 0.5 mV (hippocampus), 0.1 mV (neocortex), 200 ms. Pooled mean power spectra (60-s epochs) show
lack of signiﬁcant effect of phenytoin on hippocampal persistent gamma (n ⫽ 5, P ⬎ 0.05), but abolition of neocortical gamma (n ⫽ 6). (B) Effects of phenytoin
on FRB spike generation during kainate-induced gamma oscillations in neocortex. Upper shows 0.5-s epoch of FRB behavior in control conditions (ﬁeld gamma

Phenytoin (a blocker of persistent gNa) suppressed FRB, and, because FRB cells are present in cortex but not in hippocampus, this ﬁnding suggests that FRB cells
contribute to persistent gamma oscillations in cortex. [Note that phenytoin reduces persistent Na⫹ conductance both in cortex (31) and in hippocampus (33).]

potentials (mostly inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, in both
model and experiment, e.g., Fig. 2). Experimental values for
mean number of spikes per wave were FS cells: 0.82 ⫾ 0.11 (n ⫽
5); LTS cells: 0.13 ⫾ 0.05 (n ⫽ 6); FRB cells: 1.84 ⫾ 0.26 (n ⫽
4); and RS cells: 0.09 ⫾ 0.02 (n ⫽ 10). Both in model and
experiment, we found spikelets in some of the RS cells (Fig. 2 A),
but never in FRB cells experimentally. However, simulations
showed that occasional spikelets could occur in FRB cells with
lower tonic drive and altered network connectivity (data not
shown). In the model, RS spikelets occurred on average at 2.2 Hz
(12 cells) and corresponded to axonal spikes that conducted
antidromically with decrement (ref. 27 and Fig. 2 A), whereas
axonal spikes in FRB cells mainly led to full spikes or multiplets,
presumably because of the relative depolarization and altered
intrinsic currents in FRB cells. Spikelets in RS cells were clearly
distinct from EPSPs. First, their rise and decay times were some
10-fold faster than excitatory postsynaptic events (Fig. 2 A).
Second, depolarization of RS neurons led to an increase in
spikelet amplitude, whereas EPSPs could no longer be seen
above the inhibitory postsynaptic potential train. No evidence
exists yet as to the substrate for spikelet formation. The model
predicts that sharing of antidromic spikes by means of gap
junctions in an axonal plexus may be responsible. Neuronal gap
junctions in neocortex may be made up of connexin proteins
(mainly connexin 36; ref. 18) or pannexins (14). Neurons in the
superficial and deep layers of the primary auditory cortex
contained large quantities of mRNA for pannexin 1 (data not
shown) and pannexin 2 (Fig. 2C). Heteromeric hemichannels
made up of pannexins 1 and 2 form functional ionophores when
expressed in oocytes (14).

Given the multiple similarities between model and experi-
ment, we used the model to try to predict how the presence of
FRB neurons would affect gamma power (Fig. 2B). We found
that a critical minimum of FRB cells needed to be present, ⬇4%
or 5% of the neuronal population with our parameter choices, to
obtain a coherent gamma oscillation. This value was not statis-
tically significant from the incidence of FRB cells derived from
experimental data (four cells from 200 impalements, P ⬎ 0.05).
We examined FRB percentages up to 15%, which is approxi-
mately the percentage of FRB neurons found in cat visual cortex
in vivo (28), although even higher percentages have been re-
ported under natural waking conditions (29). Peak gamma
power leveled off, in our simulations, above ⬇8% FRB cells. The
threshold fraction of FRB cells required for coherent gamma is
parameter-dependent: if the tonic depolarization of RS cells is
elevated enough, then a gamma oscillation occurs with ⬍ 1%
FRB neurons, although with a higher fraction of RS spikes per
oscillation wave (data not shown).

If FRB cells are necessary for cortical gamma in vitro, one
would predict that phenytoin, an anticonvulsant drug that blocks
persistent sodium conductance, should suppress the oscillation.
Because phenytoin suppresses FRB behavior (30, 31), and
because FRB cells do not occur in hippocampus, this finding
would suggest that FRB activity may be necessary for cortical
gamma, but not for hippocampal gamma. This selective effect on
gamma frequency oscillations was seen experimentally (Fig. 3A).
Peak neocortical gamma power was reduced from 0.084 ⫾ 0.013
nV2 to 0.007 ⫾ 0.002 nV2 (P ⬍ 0.05, n ⫽ 6). Fig. 3B demonstrates
that phenytoin indeed converts neocortical FRB behavior to RS,
during bath application of kainate. As a control for effects on
network components other than FRB neuronal spiking, we
examined the effects of phenytoin on kainate-induced hip-
pocampal persistent gamma oscillations, wherein FRB neurons
have not been observed. Phenytoin did not suppress persistent
gamma oscillations in hippocampus in vitro: mean gamma power
went from 0.59 ⫾ 0.12 nV2 to 0.82 ⫾ 0.34 nV2 (n ⫽ 5, P ⬎ 0.05).

Discussion
The experimental observations demonstrated a profile of
gamma frequency oscillations qualitatively similar to that seen in
archicortex. The rhythm generated by kainate application con-
sisted of trains of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in principal
cells and, with smaller amplitude, in interneurons. The rhythm
depended on gap-junctional transmission, and ectopic spikes
were seen in most RS neurons. Such ectopic spikes, along with
electrical coupling between pyramidal neurons, lead to barrages
of EPSPs in interneurons that are necessary for the oscillation in
the hippocampus (19). This pattern of phasic excitation driving
inhibition appears also to occur in the neocortex as blockade of
phasic AMPA receptor-mediated excitation, and GABAA re-
ceptor-mediated synaptic inhibition also destroy the oscillation.
The frequency of the field oscillation also depended on the
kinetics of GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic events as was
also seen for hippocampal gamma oscillations (4, 17). However,
one striking difference between neocortical gamma oscillations
and hippocampal gamma oscillations was the sensitivity to
blockade of persistent sodium channels. The observation that
FRB behavior could be concomitantly reduced with field gamma
power in neocortex but not archicortex strongly suggested that
FRB cells play a critical role in generating neocortical gamma.
Blockade of FRB behavior still allowed FRB cells to generate
rhythmic action potential outputs but, in the presence of phe-

Fig. 4.
FRB cells are predicted to generate ﬁeld gamma oscillations through
their electrical coupling with RS axons. Power spectra are shown for three
simulations, each in a network with 6.5% FRB cells, and with blockade of
recurrent synaptic excitation between pyramidal neurons (both RS and FRB).
In the control run (i.e., no other manipulations), there is a large gamma peak,
indicating that recurrent synaptic excitation between pyramidal cells is not
required for the simulated oscillation. If, in addition, FRB neurons do not
synaptically excite interneurons, there is still a large gamma peak. Hence, FRB
cells can pace gamma activity without having any (chemical) synaptic output.
In contrast, if FRB axons are not allowed to couple electrically with RS axons
(but are allowed to couple with each other and directly synaptically excite
interneurons), then the gamma oscillation is virtually abolished. Thus, in our
model, the contribution of FRB cells to maintaining gamma is mediated by
means of electrical coupling.

nytoin, only action potential singlets were seen, as opposed to
(predominantly) multiplets in control conditions. Lowering the
proportion of FRB cells in the model was also accompanied by
a collapse in gamma power (Fig. 2B). These observations suggest
that it is the large, high-frequency, barrage of output from FRB
cells on many underlying gamma periods that is critical for their
role in neocortical rhythmogenesis.

By what mechanism is this large FRB neuron output favoring
gamma oscillations? The model, and observed experimental
effects of the gap-junction blocker carbenoxolone, provided
several suggestive insights. First, synaptic excitation of pyra-
midal cells (either RS or FRB) by the FRB cells (9) was not
sufficient for the permissive effect of the FRB neurons in the
model (control power spectrum in Fig. 4). Indeed, synaptic
excitation of interneurons by FRB neurons (9) was also not
sufficient (Fig. 4). The only other possible interaction in the
model between FRB cells and other neurons is mediated by
means of electrical coupling. Neurons in the auditory cortex
strongly express mRNA for the px2 gap-junction-forming
protein (Fig. 2C) that can form channels in conjunction with
px1 (14), which is also present (data not shown), but as yet, a
substrate for axonal gap junctions in this region remains
elusive. However, we reconfigured the network so that no
electrical couplings occurred between FRB兾RS axonal pairs,
while maintaining the total number of pyramidal cell electrical

couplings constant. In this case, even with 6.5% of pyramidal
cells being FRB cells, and with synaptic connections between
FRB cells and interneurons intact, the gamma oscillation
collapsed (Fig. 4). Hence, in the model, FRB neurons exerted
a permissive effect on gamma oscillations because their axons
were electrically coupled not only with each other, but also
with RS axons (and vice versa).
In conclusion, our combined experimental兾simulation study
demonstrated that field gamma oscillations depended on expres-
sion of FRB in a small subset of cortical neurons. The reduction
in gamma power by the gap-junction blocking agent carbenox-
olone suggested that the axons of layer II兾III are electrically
coupled, as appears to be the case for pyramidal neurons in
hippocampus (27, 32). Finally, although not a comprehensive
computational model of neocortical networks as yet, the model
predicted accurately the physiological and pharmacological ex-
perimental data presented, and suggested that RS neurons and
FRB neurons are electrically interconnected, and that such
interconnections are critical for persistent neocortical gamma
oscillations.
