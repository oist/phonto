Abstract

Background:Cardiomyocytes located at the ischemic border zone of infarcted ventricle are accompanied by redistribution
of gap junctions, which mediate electrical transmission between cardiomyocytes. This ischemic border zone provides an
arrhythmogenic substrate. It was also shown that sodium (Na+) channels are redistributed within myocytes located in the
ischemic border zone. However, the roles of the subcellular redistribution of Na+ channels in the arrhythmogenicity under
ischemia remain unclear.

Methods: Computer simulations of excitation conduction were performed in a myofiber model
incorporating both
subcellular Na+ channel redistribution and the electric field mechanism, taking into account the intercellular cleft potentials.

Results:We found in the myofiber model that the subcellular redistribution of the Na+ channels under myocardial ischemia,
decreasing in Na+ channel expression of the lateral cell membrane of each myocyte, decreased the tissue excitability,
resulting in conduction slowing even without any ischemia-related electrophysiological change. The conventional model
(i.e., without the electric field mechanism) did not reproduce the conduction slowing caused by the subcellular Na+ channel
redistribution. Furthermore, Na+ channel blockade with the coexistence of a non-ischemic zone with an ischemic border
zone expanded the vulnerable period for reentrant tachyarrhythmias compared to the model without the ischemic border
zone. Na+ channel blockade tended to cause unidirectional conduction block at sites near the ischemic border zone. Thus,
such a unidirectional conduction block induced by a premature stimulus at sites near the ischemic border zone is associated
with the initiation of reentrant tachyarrhythmias.

Conclusions:Proarrhythmia of Na+ channel blockade in patients with old myocardial infarction might be partly attributable
to the ischemia-related subcellular Na+ channel redistribution.

Introduction

Class I antiarrhythmic drugs, which block cardiac sodium (Na

)
channels, have been used to treat premature ventricular contrac-
tions
(PVCs), which degenerate into tachyarrhythmias. The
Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) [1,2] showed that
the risk of arrhythmia-related death was increased in patients with
+
old myocardial infarction, although Na
channel blockers reduced
PVCs. Therefore, the administration of Na
channel blockers to
old myocardial
infarction patients is currently contraindicated.
However, it remains controversial whether the poor prognosis is

due to the negative inotropic and/or proarrhythmic effects of Na
channel blockers.

Previous experimental studies [3–9] showed that electrophysi-
ological remodeling occurs in cardiomyocytes located at
the
ischemic border zone (IBZ) of infarcted ventricles. In particular,

i.e.,
functional remodeling [3,4] of Na
reduction in the current amplitude and alterations in the activation
and/or inactivation kinetics, was observed in myocytes isolated
from the IBZ, consequently decreasing the conduction velocity
(CV) of the excitation wavefront. If the IBZ exhibits such INa

rhythmias.
The Na

channels of the mammalian heart were inhomogen-
eously distributed within myocytes, particularly at intercalated
discs (IDs) [10–13]. Baba et al. [14] found that the subcellular
redistribution of Na
channels occurs at the IBZ of 5-day infarcted
canine ventricles. In addition, the Na
channel expressions in the

lateral cell membrane were markedly decreased, and thus the Na
channels were confined to the IDs. However, the roles of the

i.e.,

A hypothetical conduction mechanism based on the micro-
structure of ventricular myocytes,
the electric field (EF)
mechanism, has initially proposed as the main mechanism of
excitation conduction [15]. However, it has been theoretically
confirmed that the contribution of the gap junction mechanism is
the EF mechanism in the physiological
larger than that of
condition [12] and the EF mechanism serves as one of
the
homeostatic mechanisms of excitation conduction under condi-
tions of reduced gap junctional coupling in the diseased heart
[16,17]. At the same time we found that because of the EF
mechanism, CV is very sensitive to the amount of Na
channels
of lateral surface membrane (LM) despite normal gap junctional
coupling [16]. In the present study, we extend this idea to the
proarrhythmic mechanism under
conditions of 5-day
infarcted canine heart, of which gap junctional coupling is not
reduced yet [8,9]. The aim of this study was to investigate the
combined effects of the subcellular redistribution of Na
channels

Methods

Myofiber model

We constructed a myofiber of length 4.242 cm, consisting of
300 ventricular myocytes, each of which was 141.4 mm in length
and 31.1 mm in width [18–20] (Figure 1A). The myocytes were
electrically connected with both gap junctions and the EF
mechanism; the electrical communication between the adjacent
cells was mediated by the change in the large negative
extracellular potential induced at the narrow intercellular cleft
space facing the junctional membrane (JM), i.e., the ID (cleft
model [12,15–17], Figures 1B and S1). For comparison with the
cleft model, a conventional model [21] coupled only with gap
junctions was constructed (non-cleft model, Figure 1C). On the
basis of previous experimental data [8,9] showing that
the
intercellular gap junctional conductance (Gg) of the IBZ in 5-day
infarcted canine heart does not differ significantly from that of the
non-ischemic zone (NZ), we employed the same Gg in both the
IBZ and NZ myofiber models: 3.584 mS. The radial cleft
conductance (Gj) [22] and series axial cleft conductance (Gd)
were 0.25 mS and 33.8 mS, respectively, the same as in previous
studies [12,15–17].

Each myocyte in the myofiber model comprised 3 segments: 2
for the JM (i.e., post- and pre-JMs), and the other one for the LM
(Figure 1D). The membrane segments were represented by a

Computations

Numerical calculations were performed as described previously
[16] and details are provided in Text S1. Pacing stimuli of twice
the diastolic threshold were applied to the LM segment of a
myocyte located at one end of the myofiber. To obtain the CV
restitution curves, we measure the CV in the middle of
the
myofiber as a function of the S1–S2 coupling interval.

Results
Effects of subcellular Na+ channel redistribution on CV

Figures 2A and 2B show the relative ratios of CV (%CV)
normalized by CV in the myocardial fiber with 50%gNa,JM and
+
50%gNa,LM, i.e., the subcellular Na
channel distribution in the
NZ, as a function of %gNa,JM+LM in the cleft and non-cleft models,
respectively. Thus, the CVs in the cleft and non-cleft models under
NZ myofiber condition were 53.1 and 64.3 cm/s, respectively. In
the case of %gNa,JM change (Figure 2A, open circles with dashed
line), the %CV decreased not more than 10% as the %gNa,JM was
reduced under the condition with 50%gNa,LM. Meanwhile, in the
case of %gNa,LM change (Figure 2A, filled circles with solid line),
the %CV decreased markedly as a function of %gNa,LM decrease
under the condition with 50%gNa,JM. However, in the non-cleft
model
there was no significant difference in the
change in %CV in either case.

(Figure 2B),

On the basis of the experimentally measured CV [9] with
reference to the previous immunostaining data [14], we deter-
channel distribution in the IBZ as
mined the subcellular Na
50%gNa,JM and 15%gNa,LM; the CVs in the cleft and non-cleft
models were 36.4 and 55.7 cm/s, respectively.

Subcellular Na+ Channel Redistribution and Reentry

defined as the sum of post-junctional, pre-junctional, and lateral
INa values of each myocyte in the myofiber (Figures 2C and 2D).
When %gNa,JM was fixed at 50% in the cleft model, the peak
value of INa in the LM (Figure 2C, left, blue bars) decreased
gradually as a result of the reduction in %gNa,LM. The total peak
INa per myocyte (i.e.,
the maximum value of each bar in
Figure 2C, left) also decreased substantially as a result of the
reduction in %gNa,LM. In contrast, if %gNa,JM was reduced with
50%gNa,LM, the peak value of INa in the JM (Figure 2C, right,
green and magenta bars) also decreased. However, the decrease in
the total peak INa (i.e., maximum value of each bar in Figure 2C,
right) only decreased slightly, suggesting the INa in the JM (INa,JM)
contributes less to the total peak INa than the INa in the LM
(INa,LM).

For comparison, similar simulations were performed in the non-
(Figure 2D). The INa,LM decreased along with the
cleft model
reduction in %gNa,LM (Figure 2D, left, blue bars), consequently
decreasing the total peak value of the INa (i.e., maximum value of
each bar in Figure 2D, left). Likewise, INa,JM decreased along with
the reduction in the %gNa,JM (Figure 2D, right, green and
magenta bars); the total peak value of the INa also decreased
(i.e., maximum value of each bar in Figure 2D, right). However,
there was no striking difference in the change in the total peak
value of INa in either case (Figures 2D, left and right).

Effects of Na+ channel blockade on CV in NZ and IBZ
myofibers

+

Figure 3A shows CV slowing as a function of %GNa block. In
both NZ and IBZ myofibers, CVs decreased gradually with %GNa
block. Figure 3B shows typical examples of the AP propagation
observed in NZ and IBZ myofibers with 50%GNa block. The AP
of each myocyte in the NZ myofiber with 50%GNa block was able
to propagate through the myofiber (Figure 3B(i)), whereas the
same 50%GNa block in the IBZ myofiber caused AP alternans
(Figure 3B(ii)). The ionic mechanism underlying AP alternans is
shown in Figure S3. The reduction in INa,LM by the Na
channel
blocker decreased in the AP phase 0 amplitude (Figures S3A and
S3B, asterisk), leading to slow activation of L-type Ca2+
current,
ICaL (Figure S3C). The slow ICaL activation prolonged AP
duration in the IBZ myocytes, delaying phase 2 dome formation
in the AP (Figure S3A). The longer AP duration, i.e., the diastolic
(DI) shortening, further decreased INa,LM (Figure S3B,
interval
dagger). Consequently,
the AP phase 0 amplitude decreased
further, and the ICaL failed to activate (Figures S3A and S3C,
dagger). The failure of ICaL activation led to the shortening of AP
duration and prolongation of the DI. The peak INa,LM recovered
slightly as a result of the prolongation of the DI, eliciting the full
AP accompanied by the delayed phase 2 dome. The critical values
of the %GNa block maintaining stable conduction were 80% and
44% in the NZ and IBZ myofibers, respectively (Figure 3A,
bottom, red and blue bars denoted by SC, respectively). Increases
in %GNa block exceeding the critical value in both NZ and IBZ
myofibers caused unstable conduction. Typical examples of
unstable conduction observed in the IBZ myofiber are shown in
Figures 3C and 3D. The further increase in %GNa block caused
complete conduction block (Figure 3E). In the NZ myofiber, the
AP did not propagate when the entire Na
channel conductance
within the myocyte was reduced by 84%. Complete conduction
block occurred in the IBZ myofiber with a %GNa of 58%.

minimum S1–S2 interval resulting in conduction block did not
change (178 vs. 171 ms in the control, filled and gray circles at left
end of each curve, respectively). Meanwhile, in the case of the IBZ
myofiber (Figure 4B), the conduction block occurred when the
S1–S2 interval was ,181 and ,298 ms under the control and
50%GNa block, respectively. Further increasing the %GNa block
resulted in the conduction block occurring with an S1–S2 interval
of 730 ms (Figure 4B, open circle at the left end of 55%GNa block
curve). Thus, the S1–S2 interval causing conduction block was
markedly prolonged with increasing %GNa block of IBZ myocytes.
However, in NZ myocytes, even if the %GNa block was increased
by 55%, the S1–S2 interval resulting in conduction block was only
179 ms (Figure 4A, open circle).

in Figure 5A (i.e., the S1–S2 intervals from 254–280 ms in the
case of 50%GNa block) led to reentry via unidirectional conduction
block at the proximal border of the IBZ (Figure 5B(d), dagger)
followed by spontaneous termination with a collision between the

from NZ to IBZ myocytes (Figure S4B), causing the reactivation of

Discussion

+

The major findings of the present study are as follows: (1) a
decrease in the number of Na
channels from the LM of each
ventricular myocyte was a major cause of the conduction slowing
in the IBZ; (2) in the presence of EF mechanism, the relative
contribution of the INa,LM to the total INa in a myocyte that makes
up myofibers was greater than that of INa,JM;
(3) an IBZ
+
channels
accompanied by the subcellular redistribution of Na
was highly vulnerable to reentry under Na
channel blockade.
+
These findings suggest that the subcellular Na
channel redistri-
bution in the IBZ leads to decreased tissue excitability and that
+
such a phenomenon is facilitated by Na
channel blockers. Na
channel blockade tended to cause a unidirectional conduction
block toward the IBZ, resulting in the induction of reentrant
tachyarrhythmia following PVC. Thus,
the ischemia-related
channels might be partly

inward Na

myocyte was larger than that of INa,JM (Figure 2C). The decrease
in INa,LM, which accounts for a large proportion of the total INa, by
reducing %gNa,LM while maintaining %gNa,JM led to a marked
current within a myocyte
decrease in the total
(Figure 2C, left). Since then, the intracellular Na
concentration
near the pre-JM (near the cleft) becomes lower, the INa,JM flow
from the cleft to the myocyte via the pre-JM slightly increases
(Figure 2C, left, magenta bars) and therefore the cleft voltage
polarizes more negatively, resulting in the faster depolarization in
the post-JM of the adjacent myocyte (i.e., EF mechanism) [16].
Because the gap junctional current between the myocytes is very
large and is determined by the difference in membrane potentials
between pre- and post-JMs, the faster depolarization in the post-
JM (smaller time delay) via the EF mechanism largely decreases
the gap junctional current. Thus, the axial current flow within the
adjacent myocyte markedly decreases and the LM of the adjacent
myocyte depolarizes slower, resulting in the conduction delay.
Therefore, reducing %gNa,LM resulted in a significant decrease in
CV (Figure 2A). This dependence on the %gNa,LM of the CV in
the cleft model was also confirmed by additional simulations
(Figure S2A, horizontal contour lines), suggesting %gNa,LM rather
than %gNa,JM+LM is the main determinant of CV.

Cabo et al. [9] found that the CV in the IBZ of 5-day infarcted
canine ventricles is 36% slower than that in the NZ (29 vs. 45 cm/
s, respectively). The experimentally observed conduction slowing
channel
in the IBZ [9] may be attributable to the subcellular Na
redistribution via EF mechanism, because the decreased number
+
of Na
channels in the LM of myocytes in the cleft model resulted
in a similar decrease in CV (31.3%; Figure 2A, filled circles with
solid line).

+

The effects of subcellular Na

channel distribution on CV
differed between in the cleft and the conventional non-cleft models
(Figures 2A and 2B). In both models, the peak INa,LM of each
myocyte was proportional to the %gNa,LM. However, in the cleft
model, because the small Gj at
junction
(Figure 1B) attenuates the INa,JM that inflows into myocytes from
the cleft space, the contribution of INa,LM to the total peak INa per

the intercellular

+

+

(Figure 1C),

In contrast, in the conventional non-cleft model, which did not
consider the Gj
there was no difference in the
contribution of INa,JM or INa,LM to the total peak INa of each
myocyte (Figures 2D, left and right). Therefore, %gNa,JM+LM (i.e.,
channels per myocyte) rather than
the total number of Na
%gNa,LM (i.e., the heterogeneous distribution of Na
channels
within each myocyte) was the predominant determinant of CV in
the non-cleft model (Figure 2B). This was further confirmed by the
vertical contour lines of CV in the non-cleft model (Figure S2B).
Although this result is concordant with those of the previous study
[32], even with 0%gNa,LM, the conventional non-cleft model was
unable to reproduce the conduction slowing [9] caused by the
subcellular Na
channel redistribution in the IBZ [14] (Figure 2B,
filled circles with solid line).

Contribution of a cleft at the lateral membrane to the EF
mechanism

As the interstitial cleft space between adjacent myofibers is
visible by optical microscopy, the width of interstitial space (facing
at lateral membrane) is much larger than that of the intercellular
cleft space facing at the IDs (,1 mm vs. 5–25 nm). Previous studies
[12,16] found that when the intercellular cleft width is above
50 nm, the effect of the EF mechanism on excitation conduction is
lost. Therefore, the effects of EF mechanism via clefts at the lateral
membrane on the excitation conduction can be ignored.

Subcellular Na+ Channel Redistribution and Reentry

Limitations

We did not

take account
+

the ischemia-related electrical
remodeling of Na
channels [3,4]. Nevertheless, as demonstrated
+
in Figure 2C, INa can be decreased only by subcellular Na
channel redistribution. Moreover, we considered neither the other
electrical remodelings in the IBZ [5–7] nor a realistic ventricle
shape. Therefore, additional studies are required to clarify the
precise roles of the remodeling of other ion channels as well as the
more sophisticated 2- and 3-dimensional ventricular models [39]
in the ischemia-related proarrhythmic effects of class I antiar-
rhythmic drugs.

Contribution of gap junctions to conduction slowing in
the IBZ

Supporting Information

Acute myocardial ischemia-mediated gap junction lateralization
decreases the Gg of IDs, resulting in conduction slowing [33–35].
In the present study, we assumed the Gg in the IBZ was equal to
that in the NZ [8,9]. Nevertheless, the aforementioned experi-
mental data [9] could be reproduced only by reducing %gNa,LM
without altering Gg in the cleft model (Figure 2A). Therefore, we
consider that the conduction slowing and induction of reentrant
tachyarrhythmia in the IBZ are due to the subcellular Na
channel
redistribution rather than the decrease in Gg. This notion is
supported by a recent experimental study [36] showing that the
Na
channel expressions of the LM in dystrophin-deficient mouse
hearts are selectively decreased without affecting the connexin 43
expressions; consequently, the CV in the left ventricle was 28%
slower in the mutant mice than the wild type.

Proarrhythmic effects of class I antiarrhythmic drugs
under ischemia

+

+

Excitation conduction was more easily blocked by Na

channel
blockade in the IBZ than the NZ because of the marked decrease
in the excitability of IBZ (Figure 3A). Accordingly, we speculate
+
that subcellular Na
channel redistribution together with Na
channel blockade causes a unidirectional block at sites near the
IBZ. In addition, the CV restitution curves under Na
channel
blockade in the IBZ (Figure 4B) suggest that PVCs can easily
causes
leading to reentry in old
myocardial infarction patients treated with class I antiarrhythmic
drugs. Indeed, Na
channel blockade with the coexistence of an
NZ and IBZ widened the vulnerable period for PVCs (Figure 5A,
red region) compared to the cases with ,14%GNa block.
Furthermore, unidirectional block induced by a stimulus applied
at a site near the IBZ initiated reentry (Figure 5B(c)).

the unidirectional block,

+

+

On the other hand, as shown in Figure 3A, there existed a range
+
of Na
channel blockade causing unstable conductions (Figures 3C
and 3D) between the ranges of stable conduction (Figure 3B) and
conduction block (Figure 3E). Such unstable conductions might be
involved in arrhythmogenic mechanisms under ischemia [37,38].
+
Baba et al. [14] have reported that the subcellular Na
channel
redistribution occurs inhomogeneously at the IBZ [14]. Therefore,
+
spatially inhomogeneous Na
channel blockade also occurs in the
IBZ, causing unstable conduction. Taken together, the present
results suggest that even if the number of PVCs is reduced as a result
of the continuous administration of class I antiarrhythmic drugs, the
+
subcellular Na
channel blockade
increases the ventricular vulnerability to PVCs,
leading to the
initiation of reentrant tachyarrhythmias and consequently more
arrhythmic events [1,2].
