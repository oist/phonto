(IKr) blockers prolong action potential (AP) duration (APD) in a
reverse-frequency-dependent manner and may induce arrhythmias,
including torsade de pointes in the ventricle. The IKr blocker dofetilide
has been approved for treatment of atrial arrhythmias, including
ﬁbrillation. There are, however, a limited number of studies on the
action of IKr blockers on atrial AP. When we tested a mathematical
model of the human atrial AP (M Courtemanche, RJ Ramirez, S
Nattel. Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 275: H301–H321, 1998) to
examine the effects of dofetilide-type IKr blockade, this model could
not reproduce the reverse-frequency-dependent nature of IKr blockade
on atrial APD. We modiﬁed the model by introducing a slowly
activating K⫹ current activation parameter. As the slow time constant
was increased, dofetilide-type blockade induced more prominent re-
verse-frequency-dependent APD prolongation. Using the modiﬁed
model, we also examined the effects of two more types of IKr
blockade similar to those of quinidine and vesnarinone. Voltage- and
time-dependent block of IKr through the onset of inhibition by quin-
idine is much faster than by vesnarinone. When we incorporated the
kinetics of the effects of these drugs on IKr into the model, we found
that quinidine-type blockade caused a reverse-frequency-dependent
prolongation of APD that was similar to the effect of dofetilide-type
blockade, whereas vesnarinone-type blockade did not. This ﬁnding
coincides with experimental observations. The lack of the reverse
frequency dependence in vesnarinone-type blockade was accounted
for by the slow development of IKr blockade at depolarized potentials.
These results suggest that the voltage- and time-dependent nature of
IKr blockade by drugs may be critical for the phenotype of the drug
effect on atrial AP.

THE DELAYED RECTIFIER K⫹ current (IK) contributes to the phase
2 and phase 3 repolarization of the cardiac action potential
(AP) and,
thus, controls AP duration (APD). The rapidly
activating K⫹ current (IKr) and the slowly activating K⫹
current (IKs) are two distinct components of IK in many
mammals, including humans (28, 29, 37). IKr inhibition by a
number of cardiac and noncardiac drugs prolongs the QT
interval and causes arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes
in the ventricle (1). The contribution of IKr relative to IKs in AP
repolarization is greater during bradycardia than during tachy-

the amplitude of IKs

cardia: during tachycardia,
increases
because of its slow deactivation, whereas the amplitude of IKr
remains nearly the same (12). As a result, drugs such as
dofetilide and E-4031, which speciﬁcally inhibit IKr, prolong
APD more prominently during bradycardia (17, 18, 32). This
phenomenon is called “reverse frequency dependence.” The
reverse-frequency-dependent nature of a drug’s effect is con-
sidered, at least in part, to be responsible for inducing exces-
sive prolongation of APD and torsades de pointes during
bradycardia (11). It is a critical indicator of the arrhythmogenic
potential of a drug (34).

Drugs such as dofetilide and E-4031 block IKr in a voltage-
and time-independent manner (32, 33). On the other hand, we
showed that the positive inotropic agent vesnarinone and the
widely used class Ia antiarrhythmic drug quinidine inhibit
current ﬂowing through the pore-forming subunit of IKr, HERG
(human ether-a-go-go-related gene), in a voltage- and time-
dependent manner (13, 33). Although both drugs inhibit the
current more potently and rapidly as the membrane potential is
depolarized, the development of blockade at the same potential
is much faster with quinidine than with vesnarinone (13, 33).
Accordingly, IKr blockade by drugs can be classiﬁed into at
least three representative groups: voltage- and time-indepen-
dent blockade (e.g., by dofetilide and E-4031), fast voltage-
and time-dependent blockade (e.g., by quinidine), and slow
voltage- and time-dependent blockade (e.g., by vesnarinone).
Previous studies have shown that although dofetilide and
quinidine cause reverse-frequency-dependent prolongation of
APD, vesnarinone does not (10, 12, 32) and that, clinically,
dofetilide and quinidine often cause torsades de pointes, but
vesnarinone does not (7, 30). These different effects among the
drugs may be due to the differences in their kinetics of HERG
blockade (13, 33), but the underlying mechanism has not been
fully clariﬁed.

IKr and IKs were also found in human atrial myocytes (37),
and, recently, the IKr-speciﬁc blocker dofetilide was approved
for treatment of atrial ﬁbrillation (AF) (6). Therefore, the
action of IKr blockers on atrial, as well as ventricular, APs is of
interest. The aims of this study were 1) to establish a human
atrial AP model that can differentiate the effects of drugs with
the three distinct IKr blockade kinetics, 2) to elucidate the
underlying mechanism of the different effect of IKr blockade
on APD prolongation, and 3) to predict the requirement for
non-reverse-frequency-dependent prolongation of APD in IKr
blockade. To examine the effects of pure IKr blockade on APD,
other possible effects by the IKr blockers [e.g., blockade of

ultrarapid delayed rectiﬁer K⫹ current (IKur) and inactivating
transient outward K⫹ current (Ito) by quinidine] needed to be
excluded. This is very difﬁcult, if not impossible, in vitro.
However, in silico approaches can realize such hypothetical
experimental conditions. Therefore, we have developed an
applicable human atrial AP model.

We ﬁrst examined the effect of IKr blockade caused by
dofetilide on the model of human atrial AP that was developed
by Courtemanche et al. (2). We found that this model could not
reproduce dofetilide’s reverse-frequency-dependent prolonga-
tion of atrial APD. To correct this defect, we incorporated the
slow component of IKs (27, 31) into the model. The modiﬁed
model reproduced and accounted for the different frequency-
dependent responses of APD due to three kinetically distinctive
IKr blockade types. These results suggest that the voltage and
time dependence of IKr blockade by drugs may be critical for
the phenotype of drug effect on atrial AP.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

AP simulation. To simulate the human atrial AP, we used the
mathematical model developed by Courtemanche et al. (2). Brieﬂy,
this model has passive properties (e.g., membrane capacitance and
membrane resistance) and 12 voltage-dependent and carrier-mediated
ionic currents as follows: fast Na⫹ current (INa), inward rectiﬁer K⫹
current (IK1), Ito, IKur, IKr, IKs, L-type Ca2⫹ current (ICa,L), sarcolem-
mal Ca2⫹ pump current (Ip,Ca), Na⫹-K⫹ pump current (INaK), Na⫹/
Ca2⫹ exchanger current (INaCa), background Na⫹ current (Ib,Na), and
background Ca2⫹ current (Ib,Ca). Hodgkin-Huxley-type equations are
used to calculate the forward and backward kinetics of the activation
and inactivation processes of each voltage-gated ion channel. The
program was coded in C/C⫹⫹, and simulations were run on an
IBM-compatible computer with a C⫹⫹ compiler.

IKs in the original atrial AP model of Courtemanche et al. (2) is

expressed as follows

IKs ⫽ gKs xs

where gKs is the maximum conductance for IKs, xs is the activation
gate variable for IKs, V is the membrane potential, and EK is the

model of Courtemanche et al. is assumed to have one gate represented

ever, that IKs possesses at least two (fast and slow) activation pro-
cesses (27, 31). The time constant in the original model of Courte-
manche et al. represents only the fast process. An additional slow
activation process was introduced into the formulation of IKs in our
model in a manner similar to that in the Luo-Rudy (LRd) model, the
de facto standard guinea pig ventricle cell model (35). We modiﬁed
this to incorporate two activation processes as follows

IKs ⫽ gKs xs1xs2共V ⫺ EK兲

(2)
where xs1 and xs2 are the fast and slow activation gate variables,
respectively. Although the time constant of xs1 [␶x(s1)] was set to be
the same as the value of the time constant of xs in the original model
of Courtemanche et al., that of xs2 [␶x(s2)] was two, four, or six times
␶x(s1). The maximum IKs conductance was adjusted in each case so
that the APD in the control at 1,000-ms cycle length (CL) did not
change from that of the original model: it was 0.129, 0.187, 0.251, and
0.277 mS/␮F for the original and the two-, four-, and sixfold in-
creases, respectively.

Thirty AP simulations were run at each CL. The last AP in each run
was used for analysis. The APD was measured at ⫺70 mV, which
closely approximates APD at 90% repolarization (APD90).

Formulation of kinetic properties of IKr blockade types. To incor-
porate the effects of the three blockade groups, we modiﬁed the
formulation of IKr given by Courtemanche et al. (2) as follows

where i represents the blockade type where dofetilide type is the
voltage- and time-independent blockade, quinidine type is the voltage-
dependent blockade with fast development, and vesnarinone type is
the voltage-dependent blockade with slow development, yi is the
fraction of IKr that is not blocked by drug type i, gKr is the maximum
conductance of IKr, and xr is the activation gate variable,.

Dofetilide blocks IKr in a voltage- and time-independent manner
(33). Therefore, dofetilide represents the voltage- and time-indepen-
dent blockade and ydofetilide type was set to 0.1.

On the other hand, the effects of the two types of voltage- and
time-dependent blockade were calculated with the following ﬁrst-
order differential equation

where i represents the blockade type where quinidine or vesnarinone,
yi is the state variable of the unblocked fraction of IKr in the presence
of drug type i, y⬁,i, is the steady-state value of yi, and ␶i is the time
constant for yi. Simulations of y⬁,i and ␶i derived from our experi-
mental data for quinidine and dofetilide (33) and vesnarinone (13) are
shown in Fig. 1.

same way,
the values in the formulas for y⬁,vesnarinone type and
␶vesnarinone type were derived from Katayama et al. (13). The experi-
mental data for the temperature sensitivity of IKr blockade by these
drugs are not available. However, because it was reported that the
temperature dependence of IKr blockade is usually not prominent in
various drugs (14), we assumed that the temperature difference among
these experiments would not largely affect the present model results.
Furthermore, in this study, we adopted the kinetics of dofetilide,
quinidine, and vesnarinone from our previous experimental results
only to represent the three representative types of IKr blockade by

various drugs, and we did not intend to reproduce precisely the
experimental results of the effects of these drugs on atrial AP. These
formulations are used to simulate the development and recovery from
blockade for dofetilide, quinidine, and vesnarinone (Fig. 2). For
simulation of development of blockade, voltage steps (1-s duration)
from a holding potential of ⫺80 mV to between ⫺20 and ⫹40 mV
with a 20-mV increment (Fig. 2, A–C) were used. For simulation of
recovery from blockade, voltage steps (10-s duration) from a holding
potential of ⫹40 mV to between ⫺40 and ⫺100 mV with a 20-mV
increment were used (Fig. 2, D–F). Although the kinetics of quinidine
blockade are complex and consist of at least two exponential compo-
nents (33), we treated this as a single-exponential process (Fig. 2, A
and D) (33). Block and recovery due to vesnarinone could be repre-
sented by single exponentials (Fig. 2, B and E) (13). Blockade by
dofetilide was constant (Fig. 2, C and F) (33).

RESULTS

Incorporation of a slow component into IKs and its effect on
APD prolongation caused by reduced IKr density. We began
with the original mathematical model for human atrial AP that
had been developed by Courtemanche et al. (2). We ﬁrst
examined the frequency dependence of APD under control
conditions and in the presence of a voltage- and time-indepen-
dent IKr blocker represented by dofetilide (Fig. 3A). The APs
exhibit the spike-and-dome morphology commonly observed
in human atrial recordings. Several class III antiarrhythmic
agents such as dofetilide cause a voltage- and time-independent
blockade of IKr or HERG current (33). The blocking effect of
these drugs was termed “dofetilide-type” in the present study

and is modeled by reducing the maximum conductance of IKr
to 10% of the control (see MATERIALS AND METHODS). Dofetilide-
type 90% blockade of IKr prolonged the late phase of repolar-
ization at any CL but
left AP amplitude and the resting
potential unchanged (Fig. 3A). This effect is consistent with the
experimental data for dofetilide and E-4031 (12, 18). The
effect of CL on APD under control conditions and with 90%
blockade of IKr is shown in Fig. 3Ca. In control conditions,
APD slightly increased when CL was increased from 500 to
700 ms, and APD reached a plateau value of ⬃300 ms at
⬎800-ms CL. This frequency dependence of the original
model correctly captured the feature of the experimental result
in the control condition (8). However, when the maximum IKr
conductance was reduced to 10% of control to simulate the
voltage- and time-independent blockade, APD⫺70 mV was pro-
longed at all CLs and the CL-dependent increase of APD
reached a plateau value of ⬃400 ms at ⬃1,000-ms CL. Previ-
ous experimental results showed reverse-frequency-dependent
prolongation of APD in the atrium at 1,500-ms CL in guinea
pig with dofetilide (18) and also in humans with quinidine and
ﬂecainide (10). Therefore, the plateau at 1,000-ms CL in the
original model is not consistent with the most likely estimation
that the reverse-frequency-dependent APD prolongation may
also be observed at up to 1,500-ms CL in the human atrium
with dofetilide. When APD prolongation was normalized to
500-ms CL, dofetilide-type inhibition of IKr (Fig. 3Cc) clearly
demonstrated a CL-dependent increase of APD⫺70 mV only at
⬍1,000-ms CL.

IKr blockade during 10,000-ms voltage steps from ⫹40 to ⫺40, ⫺60, ⫺80, and ⫺100 mV. Value for ydepolarization was set to 0.1 for each drug type.

The repolarization current for AP in cardiac myocytes is
mainly composed of IKr and IKs. As shown by Jurkiewicz and
Sanguinetti (12) in guinea pig ventricular myocytes, although
the magnitude of IKr activated during depolarizing pulses
remains nearly constant at different CLs because of its quick
activation, that of IKs becomes larger as the stimulation rate is
increased. As a result, the effect of IKr blockade on AP is
relatively small at fast stimulation rate, where the IKs is enhanced.
It is thus widely accepted that the different level of activation of
IKs at different CLs is the major cause of the reverse-frequency-
dependent nature of APD under blockade of IKr. Therefore, we
examined the possibility that inappropriate modeling of IKs
activation/deactivation may account for the failure of the orig-
inal model of Courtemanche et al. (2) to reproduce the phe-
nomenon.

Activation of IKs contains fast and slow processes (27, 31).
IKs in the model of Courtemanche et al. (2) has one fast
activation process. Therefore, we incorporated a second vari-
able for slow kinetics (xs2) into the activation gate of IKs
(Eq. 2). The time constant of slow activation of IKs has been
reported to be three to ﬁve times larger than that of fast
activation (31). Therefore, we set the slow time constant [␶x(s2)]
to two, four, or six times ␶x(s1) (Fig. 4). For each value of ␶x(s2),
the maximum conductance of IKs was adjusted to maintain the
AP conﬁguration at 1,000-ms CL.

In Fig. 3B, the modiﬁed model with IKs and ␶x(s2) six times
␶x(s1) is used to simulate APs at various CLs. The modiﬁed
model exhibits a spike-and-dome morphology similar to the
original model of Courtemanche et al. (2). At 500-ms CL, APD
of the modiﬁed model was slightly shorter than APD of the

original model, but at 1,000- and 1,500-ms CL, APDs of the
modiﬁed model were nearly the same as APD of the original
model. When IKr was reduced to 10% of the control to simulate
the voltage- and time-independent blockade, the prolongation
of APD with longer CL was more prominent in the modiﬁed
model.

The effect of varying ␶x(s2) on CL-dependent prolongation of
APD⫺70 mV in the presence of the voltage- and time-indepen-
dent blocker is shown in Fig. 3Cb. In control conditions, as
␶x(s2) increased, APD⫺70 mV at 500-ms CL decreased, but ␶x(s2)
had less effect at ⱖ1,000-ms CL. When IKr was reduced as
␶x(s2) was increased, CL-dependent prolongation of APD⫺70 mV
was more apparent, and the slope of the CL-APD⫺70 mV
relation became steeper. When ␶x(s2) was set to four or six
times ␶x(s1), APD⫺70 mV did not reach a plateau until 1,500-ms
CL. In addition, normalization of APD⫺70 mV prolongation
caused by reduced IKr density (Fig. 3Cc) clearly demonstrated
that the prolongation of APD⫺70 mV caused by IKr reduction
depends on ␶x(s2). Clearly, these results more closely resemble
experimental results (12, 18) than those obtained with the
original model of Courtemanche et al. (2) (Fig. 3Ca). There-
fore, in the following studies, we used the modiﬁed model with
␶x(s2) set to six times ␶x(s1).

Comparison of delayed rectiﬁer currents in original and
modiﬁed models. Figure 5 shows IKr and IKs during APs at
various CLs in the original and modiﬁed models. Since the
formulation of IKr was not modiﬁed, the form and amplitude of
IKr during each AP at each CL in the original (Fig. 5A) and
modiﬁed (Fig. 5B) models were very similar. The peak of IKr
during an AP increased as APD was prolonged, because the

activation process of IKr progressed during an AP, even in the
presence of very rapid C-type inactivation (36). As CL in-
creased, IKr increased by the same amount in both models,
although at 500-ms CL, the peak of IKr was slightly smaller
during an AP in the modiﬁed than in the original model.

In the original model, IKs increased as CL increased, similar
to IKr (Fig. 5A). On the other hand, in the modiﬁed model, IKs
decreased as CL increased (Fig. 5B), which is consistent with
the experimental results shown by Jurkiewicz and Sanguinetti
(12). Analysis of the gating variables (gate in Fig. 5) indicates
that the difference in the behavior of IKs in the two models may
be attributed mainly to the properties of xs2. Because its time
constant was slow, xs2 showed only slight variation during an
AP: it increased slowly during depolarization and declined
slowly during repolarization (Fig. 5B gate, thick continuous
line). At 500-ms CL, xs2 at the onset of an AP was high and
decreased as CL was prolonged to 1,000 and 1,500 ms. In
contrast, the fast gating variables, xs in the original model (Fig.

5A) and xs1 in the modiﬁed model (Fig. 5B gate, thin line),
increased rapidly during depolarization and decreased rapidly
during repolarization.

As a result of these differences, deactivation of the product
of xs1 and xs2 in Eq. 2 for the modiﬁed model is slower than
2 in Eq. 1 in the original model. Consequently,
deactivation of xs
at short CL in the modiﬁed model, IKs showed little deactiva-
tion at the end of repolarization, and its initial jump at the onset
of the next AP was large; with increasing CL, deactivation
could develop further, and the amplitude of the initial jump
decreased markedly. After the initial jump, IKs increased dur-
ing an AP, but the combination of a slower activation and the
decline of the initial current meant that the peak of IKs during
an AP decreased as CL was prolonged. On the other hand, in
the original model, deactivation was more rapid, and the initial
jump of IKs was less at 500-ms CL and was inﬂuenced less by
increasing CL. IKs increased rapidly during an AP because of
its fast activation kinetics, and peak IKs increased with CL.

modiﬁed model that can reproduce the experimental data for
the frequency-dependent behavior of IKs and APD.

Effects of IKr blockers on APD prolongation. Experimen-
tally, it is also recognized that excessive AP prolongation is
quite divergent among dofetilide, quinidine, and vesnarinone
(10, 12, 32). We next examined how voltage- and time-
dependent kinetics in IKr blockade affect the reverse frequency
dependence of APD prolongation in the model. Although
dofetilide and E-4031 block IKr in a voltage-independent man-
ner, quinidine and vesnarinone do so in a voltage- and time-
dependent manner (13, 33). Both drugs inhibit the current more
potently and rapidly as the membrane potential is more depo-
larized. However, at the same depolarized potential, the devel-
opment of block is much faster with quinidine than with
vesnarinone. To isolate the effects of these three typical kinetic
properties of IKr blockade, we ﬁxed their maximal effect to
correspond to 90% block of IKr. Thus we calibrated the
blockades with different kinetics by assuming the same possi-
ble maximal block effect, so that the effects of the kinetics of
IKr blockade on APD can be compared selectively. This is
represented in the calculations as a steady-state unblocked

Finally, in the original model, the relative proportions of IKr

In the modiﬁed model, the contribution of IKr to the total
repolarizing current increased with CL (Fig. 5B). Thus it is the

EFFECTS OF IKr BLOCKERS ON ATRIAL ACTION POTENTIAL

modiﬁed model. A: effect of CL on APD

blockade but showed a similar reverse frequency dependence.
Vesnarinone-type blockade was weaker than quinidine- or
dofetilide-type blockade, and it showed no frequency depen-
dence at ⬎800-ms CL. The result in relative terms also more
clearly demonstrates no frequency dependence of vesnarinone-
type blockade at ⬎800-ms CL; thus frequency dependence is
similar for vesnarinone-type blockade and control (Fig. 6B).
These results are consistent with experimental ﬁndings (10, 12,
32). We conclude that the modiﬁed model can reproduce the
characteristic frequency-dependent prolongation of atrial APD
by the IKr blockers with the three representative kinetics.

Figure 7 shows the effects of the three drugs on AP conﬁg-
uration and the two delayed rectiﬁer currents IKr and IKs. At
500-, 1,000-, and 1,500-ms CL, all three drug types signiﬁ-
cantly prolonged AP without affecting the AP amplitude and
the resting potential (Fig. 7). With increasing CL, quinidine-
and dofetilide-type blockade progressively prolongs APD to a
similar extent, whereas vesnarinone-type blockade became less
effective (see also Fig. 6B).

To determine the mechanisms underlying these different
effects, the unblocked fractions of IKr (yi), the total amount of
repolarization current (IKr ⫹ IKs), and the contribution of IKr to
the repolarization current [IKr/(IKr ⫹ IKs)] were examined (Fig.
7). The dofetilide-type blocking effect (ydofetilide type) was con-
stant and independent of CL (Fig. 4, unblocked fraction).
Vesnarinone- and quinidine-type drugs cause voltage- and
time-dependent blockade of IKr (Figs. 1 and 2), with blockade
during depolarization and recovery during repolarization. The
corresponding values for yquinidine type and yvesnarinone type de-
crease with depolarization and increase with recovery (Fig. 7,
unblocked fraction). The values for yquinidine type and yvesnarinone
type are maximal just before each AP. As CL increases, these
maximum values for yquinidine type and yvesnarinone type increase as
the time allowed for unblocking increased. At the onset of an AP,
yquinidine type decreases, and during the AP it reaches a minimum
value of ⬃0.2 irrespective of CL. This shows that, in practical
terms, quinidine blocks IKr in a frequency-independent manner
because of its fast blocking kinetics. Therefore, quinidine- and
dofetilide-type blockades have functionally similar effects on
IKr during AP, although they have very different kinetics. In
contrast, the minimum value of yvesnarinone type was depen-
dent on CL; that is, maximum blockade of IKr by vesnari-
none was attenuated as CL was prolonged.

The total delayed rectiﬁer current increases with increasing
CL under control conditions (Fig. 7, IKr ⫹ IKs) because of the
increase in IKr [Fig. 7, IKr/(IKr ⫹ IKs); see also Fig. 5B, IKr]. In
the presence of a vesnarinone-type drug, total IK also increased
with increasing CL, because the relative proportion of IKr also
increased. As a result, vesnarinone-type blockade did not
induce reverse-frequency-dependent prolongation of APD. In
contrast,
in the presence of dofetilide- and quinidine-type
drugs, total IK decreased as CL was prolonged. This is due to
their constant maximum blockade of IKr over a wide range of
CL and the reduction of IKs with longer CL. As a result, APD
prolongation with CL was enhanced by dofetilide- and quini-
dine-type blockade.

DISCUSSION

The major ﬁndings in this study are as follows. 1) Incorpo-
ration of a slow process of activation into IKs enabled a human
atrial AP model to reproduce the reverse-frequency-dependent
elongation of APD that is associated with the reduction of IKr.
2) This model could account for the mechanisms underlying
the difference between the frequency-dependent effects of the
three kinetically distinctive types (dofetilide, quinidine, and
vesnarinone) of IKr blockade on APD. 3) The analysis with the
models predicted that the drugs with the voltage- and time-
dependent IKr blockade with slow kinetics may be good can-
didates without the adverse effect of arrhythmias.

There are many mathematical models for cardiac APs, e.g.,
models for Purkinje ﬁbers (19, 20), rabbit sinoatrial node (4),
and ventricular cells of rat (22, 23), guinea pig (35, 40), dog (9,
38), and human (24) and models for atrial cells of dog (15, 25)
and human (2, 21). No model is perfect, but each has its use for
examination of different properties of cardiac AP behavior,
with their respective limitations taken into account. In practical
terms, it is important to adjust models according to the pur-
poses for which they will be used.

A problem in pharmacology is the proarrhythmic action of
many drugs. A number of compounds inhibit IKr in cardiac
myocytes and, therefore, have the potential to prolong the AP
in a reverse-frequency-dependent manner, which could induce
torsades de pointes in the ventricle. Because of this side effect,
drugs such as terfenadine, astemizole, grepaﬂoxacin, droperi-
dol, and cisapride have been withdrawn or restricted in their

clinical application (26). Also, the development of a number of
new pharmacological agents was stopped when they were
shown to block IKr. A mathematical model of the cardiac AP
that can reproduce reverse-frequency-dependent APD prolon-
gation on IKr blockade could be used to assess the risk of such
side effects.

Inasmuch as dofetilide has been approved by the US Food
and Drug Administration for treatment of AF (6), the impor-
tance of elucidating the action of IKr blockade on atrial APD
prolongation is increasing. The model of the human atrial AP
of Courtemanche et al. (2) could not reproduce reverse-fre-
quency-dependent elongation of APD with blockade of IKr. To
reproduce this property, we introduced a slow process of
activation and deactivation of IKs, which has been identiﬁed
experimentally (27, 31). The modiﬁed human atrial AP model
reproduced reverse-frequency-dependent prolongation of atrial
APD, which results from the reduction of maximum conduc-
tance of IKr by voltage- and time-independent IKr blockers such
as dofetilide and E-4031. It also differentiates between the
effects of the voltage- and time-dependent blockade caused by
quinidine- and vesnarinone-type IKr blockers. Therefore, the
model can be used to assess the frequency-dependent action of
different types of pure IKr blockade on the human atrial AP.
Because the simulation results with pure IKr blockade are very

close to the experimental results of the effects of dofetilide,
quinidine, and vesnarinone on atrial APD (10, 18, 32), it was
also suggested that the effects of these drugs on IKr are the
major determinants for atrial APD, although quinidine is
known to affect a number of ion currents, including INa and Ito,
and vesnarinone is known to increase ICa,L (16, 39). Indeed, our
preliminary model study showed that additional blockade of
IKur and Ito only marginally enhanced the reverse frequency
dependence of APD prolongation induced purely by the quin-
idine-type blockade of IKr (not shown).

This study showed that the slow activation/deactivation of IKs
plays an important role in reproducing the reverse-frequency-
dependent APD prolongation by IKr blockers in an atrial model.
The Luo-Rudy model (35, 40), which is the de facto standard for
the guinea pig ventricular cell, also has fast and slow components
of IKs activation; in this example, the slow time constant is four
times the fast (35) (Fig. 4). Reconstitution of IKs with KvLQT1/
minK exhibited three activation processes: fast, slow, and very
slow (27). The time constants for fast and slow were 0.68 and
1.48 s, respectively, at ⫹40 mV, which approximate the fast
and slow activation processes of IKs that we use. We have not
incorporated the very slow time constant (8.0 s at ⫹40 mV)
into IKs. If this slower activation process were incorporated
into our model, the reverse-frequency-dependent APD prolon-

gation associated with the dofetilide-type of blockade of IKr
would become more prominent. Further experimental studies
are needed to identify the gating processes of IKs for further
improvement of the model.

APD is shorter in atrial cells from AF patients than from
normal subjects; this is due to electrical remodeling of atrial
myocytes, where expression of ion channel currents, including
ICa,L, Ito, IKur, and IK1,
is altered (5). Courtemanche and
colleagues (3) incorporated such changes into their original
model and examined the effects of modiﬁcation of the different
outward currents on atrial AP conﬁguration. The modiﬁed
human atrial AP model that we present here could also be
extended to an AF-atrial AP model that will be suitable for
assessing the effects of drugs with the potential to treat AF.

In conclusion, this simulation showed that slow activation
and deactivation of IKs underlie the reverse-frequency-depen-
dent atrial APD prolongation induced by IKr blockers. It also
demonstrated that the effects of these compound types on APD
prolongation depended on the kinetics of their interactions with
IKr. Further studies may provide useful information for under-
standing the underlying mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias
and estimating the balance between antiarrhythmic effect and
proarrhythmic risk of IKr blocking agents. This approach may
also be useful for the in silico design of antiarrhythmic agents.
