ABSTRACT Dynamical mechanisms of the biological pacemaker (BP) generation in human ventricular myocytes were
investigated by bifurcation analyses of a mathematical model. Equilibrium points (EPs), periodic orbits, stability of EPs, and
bifurcation points were determined as functions of bifurcation parameters, such as the maximum conductance of inward-rectiﬁer
K
current (IK1), for constructing bifurcation diagrams. Stable limit cycles (BP activity) abruptly appeared around an unstable EP
via a saddle-node bifurcation when IK1 was suppressed by 84.6%. After the bifurcation at which a stable EP disappears, the
IK1-reduced system has an unstable EP only, which is essentially important for stable pacemaking. To elucidate how individual
sarcolemmal currents contribute to EP instability and BP generation, we further explored the bifurcation structures of the system
during changes in L-type Ca21
exchanger current (INaCa).
Our results suggest that 1), ICa,L is, but IK or INaCa is not, responsible for EP instability as a requisite to stable BP generation; 2),
IK is indispensable for robust pacemaking with large amplitude, high upstroke velocity, and stable frequency; and 3), INaCa is the
dominant pacemaker current but is not necessarily required for the generation of spontaneous oscillations.

INTRODUCTION

1

The cardiac biological pacemaker (BP) was recently created
current (IK1)
by genetic suppression of the inward-rectiﬁer K
in guinea pig ventricular myocytes (1), suggesting possible
development of the functional BP as a therapeutic alternative
to the electronic pacemaker. A ﬁrst step for creation of the
functional BP would be engineering of single BP cells,
which requires deep understanding of the BP mechanisms.
Using the Luo-Rudy guinea pig ventricle model (2), Silva
and Rudy (3) simulated BP activity by reducing IK1 con-
ductance (gK1) and investigated the ionic mechanisms of BP
generation in the IK1-downregulated ventricular myocyte.
They reported that BP activity was yielded by 81% sup-
pression of IK1, concluding that Na
exchanger current
(INaCa) was the dominant pacemaker current. However, the
mechanistic difference between ventricular pacemaking and
natural sinoatrial (SA) node pacemaking, as well as whether
IK1 downregulation also induces BP activity in human
ventricular myocytes (HVMs), remains to be clariﬁed.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms of
BP generation in IK1-downregulated HVMs and the roles of
individual sarcolemmal currents in HVM pacemaking in
terms of the nonlinear dynamics and bifurcation theory. In
previous studies (4–11), bifurcation structures of ventricular
or SA node models, i.e., ways of changes in the number or
stability of equilibrium and periodic states of the model
systems, were investigated for elucidating the mechanisms of
normal and abnormal pacemaker activities. These theoretical

works indicate that the mathematical approach provides a
convenient way of understanding how individual currents
contribute to pacemaker activities. In this study, therefore,
local stability and bifurcation analyses, as well as numerical
simulations, were performed for a mathematical model of the
HVM. We constructed bifurcation diagrams by calculating
equilibrium points (EPs), periodic orbits, stability of the EP,
and saddle-node or Hopf bifurcation points as functions of
bifurcation parameters (for details, see Theory and Methods).
During IK1 suppression, BP activity abruptly emerged around
an unstable EP via a saddle-node bifurcation at which a stable
EP corresponding to the resting state disappeared. Our re-
sults suggested that BP activity could be developed by
reducing IK1 alone in HVMs as well and that the instability of
an EP at depolarized potentials is essentially important for
BP generation.

To elucidate the ionic mechanisms of EP destabilization
and BP generation in the IK1-downregulated HVM, we further
explored bifurcation structures of the IK1-reduced BP system
during decreases or increases in an L-type Ca21
channel
currents (IK), and INaCa,
current (ICa,L), delayed-rectiﬁer K
which appear to be essentially important for pacemaker
generation (3,11). Moreover, we determined stability of the
BP system at the steady-state potential (V0) during appli-
cations of the constant bias current (Ibias) and how the un-
stable V0 and Ibias regions, where BP oscillations occur,
change with decreasing or
increasing the sarcolemmal
currents. This would reveal the contributions of each current
to EP instability and robustness of BP activity to hyper-
polarizing or depolarizing loads (11). Our study suggests that
the dynamical mechanism of the ventricular pacemaking is

Kurata et al.

essentially the same as that of the natural SA node pace-
making as reported by Kurata et al. (11).

This article clearly shows that bifurcation analyses of a
mathematical model allow us to notice the essential impor-
tance of EP instability for pacemaker generation and to
elucidate the roles of individual ionic currents in pacemaking.
Thus, the nonlinear dynamical approach is useful for general
understanding of the mechanisms of normal and abnormal
pacemaker activities and may also be applicable to engineer-
ing of a functional BP as a therapeutic alternative to the
electronic pacemaker. Deﬁnitions of the terms speciﬁc to the
nonlinear dynamics and bifurcation theory are provided at
the end of the Theory and Methods section to help understand
the theory and methods for bifurcation analysis as well as our
results and conclusions. Abbreviations and acronyms re-
peatedly used in this article are listed in Table 1.

This is usually written in the vector form

dx=dt ¼ fðxÞ;

(2)
where the state variable x is a vector-valued function of time t, and the vector
ﬁeld f is a function of the state variable x (12–14). For a model system to be
suitable for bifurcation analysis, the vector ﬁeld f should be continuous and
smooth (i.e., sufﬁciently differentiable) and should not depend on time or
initial conditions but depend only on the state variable x. Such a system is
called an ‘‘autonomous’’ system (see also Deﬁnitions of Terms at the end of
this section).

On the basis of single-cell patch-clamp data from undiseased and failing
HVMs, Priebe and Beuckelmann (15) have ﬁrst developed a single HVM
model (referred to as the Priebe-Beuckelmann (PB) model) as a modiﬁed
version of the Luo-Rudy phase II model for the guinea pig ventricle (2).
Recently, ten Tusscher et al. (16) and Iyer et al. (17) developed more
elaborate HVM models based on detailed experimental data. Their models
appear to be superior to the PB model in reproducing experimental data
but less suitable for bifurcation analyses for the following reasons: 1), the
ten Tusscher et al. model has the vector ﬁeld containing many complex
functions that are not continuous or smooth, thus they are not always
differentiable or yield noncontinuous derivatives; and 2), the Iyer et al.
model (n ¼ 67) is much larger than the PB model (n ¼ 15) or the ten
Tusscher et al. model (n ¼ 17), making bifurcation analyses practically
much harder. We have therefore chosen to modify the PB model on the basis
of recent experimental ﬁndings as well as other human or animal heart
models. The original PB model explicitly contains time t in the formula for
the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca21
release, making it nonautonomous.
Thus, modiﬁcations of the PB model were required for converting it into an
autonomous system, as well as for improving the capability of reproducing
experimental data.

The standard model for the normal activity is described as a nonlinear
dynamical system of 15 ﬁrst-order ordinary differential equations. The mem-
brane current system includes ICa,L, the rapid and slow components of IK
(denoted IKr and IKs, respectively), 4-aminopyridine-sensitive transient
(INa,b)
outward current (Ito), Na
and Ca21
pump current (INaK), INaCa, and Ca21
pump current (IpCa). The expressions for ICa,L and IKs as well as SR Ca21
release were reformulated, whereas the formulas for other ionic currents and
intracellular Ca21
handling are essentially the same as those in the original
PB model or adopted from other existing models (16,18–20). Modiﬁcations
of the model are summarized in Table 2; details on major modiﬁcations are
described below. All expressions (Eqs. 3–64) and the standard parameter
values used are provided in Appendix 1 and Table 5, respectively.

Formulation of ICa,L

The kinetics of ICa,L was described by Eqs. 3–8 with the activation (dL),
voltage-dependent inactivation (fL), and Ca21
-dependent inactivation (fCa)
gating variables. Voltage dependences of ICa,L gating kinetics in the current
(modiﬁed) and original human heart models are shown in Fig. 1 (top),
together with temperature-corrected experimental values for comparison.
As ten Tusscher et al. (16) pointed out, the steady-state activation and
inactivation curves (dLN, fLN) yielded by the original PB formulas were
somewhat unusual for unknown reasons (see Fig. 1, left top), resulting in
a very large window current. We therefore renewed the expressions for ICa,L.
For the steady-state activation and inactivation (dLN, fLN), we used the data
of Be´nitah et al. (21). The expression of the activation time constant (tdL)
was adopted from the ten Tusscher et al. model (16). The formulas for the
time constants of the voltage-dependent inactivation and recovery (tfL)
employed by the original models appeared not to ﬁt the experimental data for
single HVMs from Be´nitah et al. (21) or other articles (see Fig. 1, right top,
and also Fig. 2 E of ten Tusscher et al. (16)). Therefore, we originally
formulated tfL from the data of Be´nitah et al. (21), which were corrected for

the BP simulations and bifurcation analyses.

a temperature of 37°C with a Q10 of 2.2 and [Ca21

The t
fL data were ﬁtted to a function similar to that used by Courtemanche
et al. (19) for their human atrial model, using a least square minimization
procedure. The formula for the Ca21
-dependent inactivation (fCa,N) is also
the same as used by Courtemanche et al. (19). Maximum ICa,L was formu-
lated as a fully selective Ca21
current, with its reversal potential (ECa,L) ﬁxed
at a constant value of 152.8 mV as reported by Be´nitah et al. (21) and the
maximum conductance (gCa,L) set equal to 249.6 pS/pF at 2 mM [Ca21
]o.
The model-generated ICa,L during voltage-clamp pulses and peak ICa,L-V
relationship are depicted in Fig. 1 (bottom). The simulated peak ICa,L-V
relation is comparable to the experimental data from Be´nitah et al. (21),
Pelzmann et al. (22), and Li et al. (23).

Formulation of IKr

The kinetics of IKr was described by Eqs. 9–14 with the activation (pa) and
inactivation (pi) gating variables. Voltage dependences of IKr activation and
inactivation in the current and original human heart models are shown in
Fig. 2 (top), together with experimental data for comparison; the model-
generated IKr during voltage-clamp pulses are also depicted. There are
limited experimental data available for the gating kinetics of native IKr
channels in HVMs. Nevertheless, experimentally observed activation of
native IKr in human cardiac myocytes (24,25) appeared to be faster than
the IKr activation simulated by the original PB formulas. To formulate
IKr kinetics, the recently developed HVM models (16,17) employed the
experimental data from human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) channels
expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells (26,27), Chinese hamster
ovary cells (28), or Xenopus oocytes (29). However, voltage- and time-
dependent kinetics of expressed HERG channels appear to depend on cell
lines or conditions for expression, as well as conditions for current record-
ings such as temperatures, and thus may be different from those of native IKr
channels in human hearts (26–28,30–32). We therefore adopted the data
from HVMs of Li et al. (24) for the steady-state activation curve (pa,N) and

the formula of Courtemanche et al. (19) based on the data from human atrial
myocytes of Wang et al. (25) for the activation time constant (t
pa). We also
employed the expression of Courtemanche et al. (19) for the steady-state
inactivation curve (pi,N). No detailed experimental data are available on the
time constant of IKr inactivation (tpi) in intact HVMs. Inactivation and
recovery of native IKr in animal hearts or expressed HERG channels are very
rapid (28,33); thus, we assumed that IKr inactivation is instantaneous. The
maximum IKr conductance (gKr) was set equal to 12 pS/pF, according to the
data of Li et al. (24). With this gKr value, the complete block of IKr prolonged
the action potential duration (APD) of the model HVM paced at 1 Hz by
34.6–48.9%; the simulated APD prolongation by IKr block is comparable to
the experimentally observed effects of the selective IKr blocker E-4031 as
reported by Li et al. (24).

Formulation of IKs

On the basis of the recent data from Li et al. (24) and Vira´g et al. (34), the
kinetics of IKs was reformulated as Eqs. 15–18. Voltage dependences of IKs
kinetics in the current and original models are shown in Fig. 2 (bottom),
together with experimental data for comparison; the model-generated IKs
during voltage-clamp pulses are also depicted. Steady-state IKs activation
curve (nN) is from Li et al. (24). Vira´g et al. (34) recently reported that IKs in
HVMs slowly activates and rapidly deactivates. According to their report,
therefore, we reformulated the time constant of IKs activation (t
n) as Eq. 18.
The expression of EKs is the same as for the PB model. The maximum
conductance (gKs) was set equal to 36 pS/pF so as to yield the APD at 90%
repolarization (APD90) during 1 Hz pacing of 336 6 16 ms, as reported by
Li et al. (24).

inﬂux during the ﬁrst 2 ms after
initiation of the action potential (AP). Thus, the original PB model is a non-
autonomous system, the vector ﬁeld of which depends on time and initial
conditions, not suitable for bifurcation analysis. We had therefore to renew
the SR Ca21
release formula to convert the model into an autonomous
system. Owing to the lack of available data for updating the kinetic for-
mulation of SR Ca21
release in HVMs, we utilized simple expressions,
Eqs. 47–51. The formula for conductance of the Ca21
release channel (grel)
was adopted from Faber and Rudy (20), with the Prel value reduced to one-
third of the original value to obtain the peak [Ca21
]i transient of ;1 mM
during APs elicited at 1 Hz. For gating behaviors of the Ca21
release channel
(dR, fR), we used the expressions similar to those for the ICa,L gating
variables to make the model an autonomous system suitable for bifurcation
analyses.

with very slow long-term trends in state variables; and 2), degeneracy, with
nonuniqueness of steady-state solutions. The current model did not show
a long-term drift in the intracellular ion concentrations but reached a steady
state during pacing, as well as during BP oscillation, when the principle of
charge conservation was taken into account (35).

An n-dimensional fully differential system formulated as a cardiac
second-generation model can usually be converted into a differential-
algebraic system composed of n ÿ 1 differential equations and one algebraic
equation, resulting in n ÿ 1 equations for n unknowns (35,36). In such
a system, the Jacobian matrix of which is singular, the EP or limit cycle is
not unique but depends on initial conditions; e.g., our full system has
a continuum of EPs, because Eq. 65 can be derived from Eqs. 66, 69, and
70 (see Appendix 2). Thus, second-generation models including our full
system exhibit degeneracy not suitable for bifurcation analysis to be
applicable to isolated equilibria. As suggested by Krogh-Madsen et al.
(36), one of the ways to remove degeneracy and thus allow bifurcation
analyses of isolated equilibria is to make some ionic concentrations ﬁxed.

Determination and validation of model
HVM dynamics

Numerical methods for dynamic simulations of
HVM behaviors

Dynamic behaviors of the model HVM were determined by solving a system
of nonlinear ordinary differential equations numerically. Numerical integra-
tion, as well as bifurcation analyses, were performed on Power Macintosh
G4 computers (Apple Computer, Cupertino, CA) with MATLAB 5.2 (The
MathWorks, Natick, MA). We used the numerical algorithms available as
MATLAB ODE solvers: 1), a fourth-order adaptive-step Runge-Kutta algo-
rithm which includes an automatic step-size adjustment based on an error
estimate (37), and 2), a variable time-step numerical differentiation approach
selected for its suitability to stiff systems (38). The former (named ode45) is
the best function for most problems. However, the latter (named ode15s) was
much more efﬁcient than ode45 and both solvers usually yielded nearly
identical results. Therefore, ode15s was usually used, and ode45 was only
sometimes used to conﬁrm the accuracy of calculations. The maximum
relative error tolerance for the integration methods was set to 1 3 10

ÿ6.

assumed to carry K
ions into the cell for charge conservation. During
pacing, the model cell dynamics reached a steady state, with no long-term
drift in the state variables. Steady-state values of the resting potential, max-
imum upstroke velocity, and APD90 during 1 Hz pacing were ÿ84.9 mV,
411 V/s, and 338 ms, respectively. The diastolic [Ca21
]i and peak [Ca21

transient in the model HVM paced at 1 Hz were 0.169 and 0.961 mM,
respectively. The simulated AP parameters and [Ca21
]i dynamics of the
current and original HVM models are listed in Table 3, together with
corresponding experimental data for comparison. The AP parameters and
[Ca21
]i dynamics of the current model appear to be in reasonable agreement
with the mean experimental values recently determined for single HVMs, as
well as those of the original PB and other HVM models. The values of
[Ca21
]up were 0.41 mM (identical) for the resting state and
0.59–2.68 and 2.84–2.92 mM, respectively, in a steady state during 1 Hz
pacing. These values are comparable to the experimental data from rat and
rabbit ventricular myocytes (40,41), as well as those in the original PB
model, although experimental values for HVMs are unknown.

The peak [Ca21

]i transient predicted by the current model was a little
smaller at 2 Hz than at 1 Hz. In most experiments, however, the peak [Ca21
]i
transient and/or developed tension increased as the pacing rate increased
up to 2.5 Hz (45–47). This inconsistency may result from the lack of intra-
cellular modulating factors such as those involved in the rate-dependent
potentiation of ICa,L (48,49). Alternatively, the kinetic formulation of ICa,L
and/or SR Ca21
handling may be inappropriate. We found that the use of the
tfL formula from the ten Tusscher et al. model (16) led to the successful
reproduction of the rate-dependent increase in the peak [Ca21
]i transient.
Nevertheless, their t
fL formula was not used, because it appeared not to ﬁt
the experimental data as shown in Fig. 1 and because a very large IKs (.8
times larger than the experimental values) was required to counteract the
large ICa,L during phase 2 (16). In the preliminary study, BP dynamics or
bifurcation structures of the HVM model were not essentially altered by the
use of different formulas for ICa,L (tfL) or the change in the rate dependence
of [Ca21

]i transients.

Stability and bifurcation analyses

Constructing bifurcation diagrams

We examined how the stability and dynamics of the model cell alter with
changes in bifurcation parameters and constructed bifurcation diagrams for
one or two parameters. Bifurcation parameters chosen in this study were the

amplitude of INaCa or Ibias; the maximum conductance and INaCa amplitude
are expressed as normalized values, i.e., ratios to the control values.

In the HVM model with the ﬁxed [K

]i, 14 state variables deﬁne a 14-
dimensional state point in the 14-dimensional state space of the system. We
calculated EPs and periodic orbits in the state space. An EP was determined
as a point at which the vector ﬁeld vanishes (i.e., f(x) ¼ 0); steady-state
values of the state variables were calculated by Eqs. 65–69 (see Appendix 2).
Asymptotic stability of the EP was also determined by computing 14 eigen-
values of a 14 3 14 Jacobian matrix derived from the linearization of the
nonlinear system around the EP (for more details, see Vinet and Roberge
(7)). Periodic orbits were located with the MATLAB ODE solvers. When
spontaneous oscillation (BP activity) appeared, the AP amplitude (APA) as a
voltage difference between the maximum diastolic potential (MDP) and
peak overshoot potential (POP), as well as the cycle length (CL), was de-
termined for each calculation of a cycle. Numerical integration was con-
tinued until the differences in both APA and CL between the newly calculated
ÿ3 of the preceding APA and
cycle and the preceding one became ,1 3 10
CL values. Potential extrema (MDP, POP) and CL of the steady-state oscil-
lation were plotted against bifurcation parameters. When periodic behavior
was irregular or unstable, model dynamics were computed for 60 s; all
potential extrema and CL values were then plotted in bifurcation diagrams.
Codimension one and two bifurcations to occur in the model system were
explored by constructing bifurcation diagrams with one and two parameters,
respectively (10,11). For construction of one-parameter bifurcation diagrams
in which values of a state variable at EPs or extrema of periodic orbits are
shown as a function of one bifurcation parameter, a bifurcation parameter
was systematically changed while keeping all other parameters at their

standard values. The membrane potential (V) at EPs (steady-state branches)
and local potential extrema of periodic orbits (periodic branches) were
determined and plotted for each value of the bifurcation parameter. The
saddle-node bifurcation point at which two EPs coalesce and disappear was
determined as a point at which the steady-state current-voltage (I/V) curve
and zero-current axis come in touch with each other. The Hopf bifurcation
point at which the stability of an EP reverses was also detected by the
stability analysis as described above. For construction of two-parameter
bifurcation diagrams in which codimension one bifurcation points are
plotted in a parameter plane, the secondary parameter was systematically
changed with the primary parameter ﬁxed at various different values. The
path of saddle-node and Hopf bifurcation points was traced in the parameter
plane; i.e., bifurcation values for the secondary parameter were plotted as
a function of the primary parameter.

system A is considered structurally more stable than system B when the
amplitude of Ibias required for stabilizing an EP or causing a bifurcation to
quiescence is greater in system A than in system B (11). Thus, the larger the
unstable Ibias range over which limit cycles continue is, the more structurally
stable the system is.
The Hopf and saddle-node bifurcation points, as well as the control V0 at
Ibias ¼ 0, in the Ibias-V0 curve were determined as functions of bifurcation
parameters and plotted on both the potential and current coordinates, as in
previous studies (7,11). Exploring how the unstable V0 and Ibias regions
change with decreasing or increasing the sarcolemmal currents would enable
us to determine the contribution of each current to the structural stability of
the BP system to hyperpolarizing or depolarizing loads, as well as to EP
instability itself, which is evaluated by positive real parts of eigenvalues of
Jacobian matrices (see Fig. 4 of Kurata et al. (11)).

Deﬁnition and evaluation of structural stability for
the BP system

We also evaluated the structural stability of the BP system, which is deﬁned
as the robustness of pacemaker activity to various interventions or modi-
ﬁcations that may cause a bifurcation to quiescence or irregular dynamics
(11). Interventions or modiﬁcations leading to quiescence or irregular
dynamics include injections of Ibias, electrotonic loads of normal HVMs,
current leakage via myocardial injury, and intrinsic changes in channel
conductance or gating kinetics. In this study, the structural stability of the BP
system was tested for hyperpolarizing and depolarizing loads by exploring
bifurcation structures during applications of Ibias.

The way of evaluating the structural stability to Ibias is essentially the
same as in our previous study for the SA node pacemaker (11). Changes in
V0 and its stability with Ibias applications were depicted as the Ibias-V0 curve
(for more details, see Fig. 1 of Kurata et al. (11)). There are one or two Hopf
bifurcation points and two saddle-node bifurcation points corresponding to
the current exrema in the Ibias-V0 curve. In the unstable Ibias region between
two Hopf (or a Hopf and saddle-node) bifurcation points, the system has an
unstable EP only, usually exhibiting stable limit cycles without annihilation
(6,8). When the system removes to the stable Ibias region, it would come to
rest at the stable EP via gradual decline of limit cycles, annihilation, or
irregular dynamics, as reported by Guevara and Jongsma (8). Note that

Deﬁnitions of terms speciﬁc to nonlinear
dynamics and bifurcation theory

Autonomous system

An nth-order ‘‘autonomous’’ continuous-time dynamical system is deﬁned
by the state equation dx/dt ¼ f(x), where the vector ﬁeld f, a smooth function
of the state variable x ¼ x(t), does not depend on time, but depends only on
the state variable x (13).

Nonautonomous system

An nth-order ‘‘nonautonomous’’ continuous-time dynamical system is
deﬁned by the state equation dx/dt ¼ f(x, t), where the vector ﬁeld f depends
on time, i.e., explicitly contains time t (13).

EP

A time-independent steady-state point at which the vector ﬁeld vanishes
(i.e., dx/dt ¼ 0) in the state space of an autonomous system, constructing the
steady-state branch in one-parameter bifurcation diagrams. This state point
corresponds to the zero-current crossing in the steady-state I/V curve, i.e.,
a quiescent state of a cell if it is stable.

Biophysical Journal 89(4) 2865–2887

2872

Periodic orbit

A closed trajectory in the state space of a system, constructing the periodic
branch in one-parameter bifurcation diagrams.

Limit cycle

A periodic limit set onto which a trajectory is asymptotically attracted in an
autonomous system. A stable limit cycle corresponds to an oscillatory state,
i.e., pacemaker activity, of a cell.

Bifurcation

A qualitative change in a solution of differential equations caused by altering
parameters, e.g., a change in the number of EPs or periodic orbits, a change
in the stability of an EP or periodic orbit, and a transition from a periodic to
quiescent state. Bifurcation phenomena we can see in cardiac myocytes
include a generation or cessation of pacemaker activity and occurrence of
irregular dynamics such as skipped-beat runs and early afterdepolarizations.

Hopf bifurcation

This is a bifurcation at which the stability of an EP reverses with emergence
or disappearance of a limit cycle, occurring when eigenvalues of a Jacobian
matrix for the EP have a single complex conjugate pair and its real part
reverses the sign through zero.

Saddle-node bifurcation

This is a bifurcation at which two EPs (steady-state branches) or two periodic
solutions (periodic branches) emerge or disappear. The saddle-node bi-
furcation of EPs occurs when one of eigenvalues of a Jacobian matrix is zero.

Codimension

The codimension of a bifurcation is the minimum dimension of the param-
eter space in which the bifurcation may occur in a persistent way (12,50). In
other words, the codimension is the number of independent conditions
determining the bifurcation (14). A bifurcation with codimension one is a
point in one-parameter bifurcation diagrams such as Fig. 6 or a line in two-
parameter bifurcation diagrams such as Fig. 7, whereas a bifurcation with
codimension two is a point in the two-parameter space.

RESULTS
BP generation in IK1-downregulated HVM

BP activity appears in model HVM during IK1 suppression

We ﬁrst examined whether IK1 downregulation leads to BP
generation in the model HVM by decreasing gK1 at an interval
of 0.01 (1%). Spontaneous oscillations (BP activity) abruptly
appeared when gK1 was reduced to 0.15 (15%). Fig. 4 shows
the simulated BP activity of the IK1-downregulated HVM
with gK1 of 0.15 or 0, depicting the membrane potential
oscillations, underlying sarcolemmal currents, and [Ca21
]i
transients in steady state. The values of MDP, POP, APA, CL,
and maximum upstroke velocity were determined for the BP
oscillations at each gK1 value. The simulated AP parameters
are listed in Table 4, together with the data from the guinea pig
ventricle (3) and rabbit SA node (51) models, as well as from
]i
real BP systems (1,52), for comparison. The average [Na
during the BP oscillations at gK1 of 0.15 and 0 were 6.55 and
6.42 mM, respectively. Decreasing gK1 caused the decrease of

from the guinea pig ventricular model (3), INaCa was the
dominant inward current during phase 4 depolarization in the
HVM pacemaking. In contrast, ICa,L was very small during
the early phase of the depolarization, although predominantly
contributing to phase 0 upstroke. INa was also very small due to
the voltage-dependent inactivation.

Ionic basis of phase 4 depolarization in simulated BP activity

Before investigating the dynamical mechanisms of BP gen-
eration via bifurcation analyses of the HVM model, we
examined the ionic basis of phase 4 depolarization of the BP
activity. The contributions of IKr and IKs deactivation, as well as
individual inward currents (ICa,L, INa, INaCa, INa,b, ICa,b), to the
pacemaker depolarization were assessed by the conventional
freezing and blocking methods (53–55). Phase 4 depolarization
of the IK1-reduced BP system disappeared on clamping IKr
deactivation (gating variable pa) at the time of MDP, but not on
clamping IKs deactivation (gating variable n). Thus, the gKr-
decay theory for the natural SA node pacemaker (53–55)
appears to be applicable to the HVM pacemaker as well.
Removal of ICa,L at the time of MDP little altered the initial
phase of pacemaker depolarization, although reducing the rate
of the later phase depolarization with cessation of BP activity.
Eliminating INa did not signiﬁcantly affect BP oscillations.
Furthermore, in the IK1-removed system, eliminating INaCa (the
most dominant pacemaker current) at the MDP abolished phase
4 depolarization, leading to cessation of BP activity, whereas
the removal of INa,b (the second dominant pacemaker current)
or ICa,b only reduced the depolarization rate.

were also plotted. There are three EPs corresponding to the

the system at gK1 ¼ 1 (denoted as EP1, EP2, and EP3). The
stability analysis revealed that EP1 with the most depolarized
potential as well as EP2 is unstable, whereas EP3 with the
most negative potential corresponding to the resting state is
stable. The zero-current potential at EP3 positively shifted
with decreasing gK1; the stable EP3 (and EP2) disappeared
via a saddle-node bifurcation when gK1 reduced to 0.154.

depolarized potentials (EP1), which is always unstable, not

Ionic bases of EP instability and BP generation
in IK1-downregulated HVM

Instability of the EP at depolarized potentials (EP1) appears
to be essentially important for BP generation. To elucidate
the ionic mechanisms of EP instability and BP generation,
therefore, we further explored how modulating individual
sarcolemmal currents or [Ca21
]i transients affects EP sta-
bility, oscillation dynamics, and bifurcation structures of the
BP system. We focused on ICa,L, IK, and INaCa, which appear
to be essentially important for BP generation.

Inﬂuences of blocking ICa,L or IK on stability and dynamics
of the BP system

Fig. 6 shows the effects of reducing the maximum conduc-
tance of ICa,L (gCa,L), IKr (gKr), or IKs (gKs) on EP stability and
BP dynamics of the IK1-removed system. The zero-current
potential (EP1) negatively shifted with decreasing gCa,L; the
EP became stable via a Hopf bifurcation when gCa,L was
reduced by 86.6%. During the gCa,L decreases, a limit cycle
(BP oscillation) gradually contracted in size and ﬁnally
disappeared at the Hopf bifurcation point. In contrast, a Hopf

Biophysical Journal 89(4) 2865–2887

bifurcation to abolish BP activity did not occur during de-
creases in gKr or gKs, although APA signiﬁcantly reduced
with decreasing gKr. Spontaneous oscillation continued even
when IKr or IKs was completely blocked, whereas it was
abolished by eliminating both IKr and IKs.

As shown in Fig. 7, we also examined the effects of
blocking ICa,L, IKr, or IKs on the unstable V0 and Ibias regions
in the Ibias-V0 curve for further clarifying the contributions of
the individual currents to EP instability and structural sta-
bility to depolarizing or hyperpolarizing loads of the BP
system. Hopf and saddle-node bifurcation points in the Ibias-
V0 curve determined with decreasing conductance values
were plotted on the potential and current coordinates to
display how blocking each current shrinks the unstable
ranges where BP oscillations occur (for more details, see
Theory and Methods). The more prominent shrinkage in the
unstable V0 region is, the greater the contribution of the
current to EP instability is; the more prominent shrinkage in
the unstable Ibias region is, the greater the contribution to the
robustness to depolarizing or hyperpolarizing loads is. The
unstable regions, shrinking with decreases in gCa,L, dis-
appeared via a codimension two saddle-node bifurcation at

peared in the system with gCa,L reduced to less than the saddle-
node bifurcation value. In contrast, reducing gKr or gKs little
affected the unstable V0 range, eigenvalues of Jacobian
matrices at V0 being not signiﬁcantly altered. The unstable
Ibias region shrunk with decreasing gKr or gKs, though it did
not disappear even when IKr or IKs was completely blocked;
the robustness to depolarizing Ibias was attenuated by decreas-
ing gKr or gKs.

currents on stability

The results shown in Figs. 6 and 7 suggest that IKr or IKs
contributes little to the instability of the EP leading to the
generation of spontaneous oscillations. To elucidate the roles
of IKr and IKs in the HVM pacemaking, we tested how the
stability and dynamics of the reduced BP system not includ-
ing either IKr or IKs are affected by incorporating different
currents. Both IKr and IKs were ﬁrst removed from the

current of linear I/V relation (IK,b) or the original IKr or IKs
(one of the three) was then incorporated. Eliminating both IKr
and IKs abolished BP activity, with the model cell coming to
a rest at a stable zero-current potential of 116.15 mV. Fig. 8
shows how EP stability and automaticity of the reduced
current conductance
system change with increasing the K
conductance increased, the
up to 10–50 pS/pF. As the K
zero-current potential was negatively shifted and eventually
destabilized via a Hopf bifurcation, with limit cycles
emerging at the bifurcation. It should be noted that all the
currents, including IK,b, could individually create an
K
unstable EP and induce spontaneous oscillations. However,
IK,b, the effect of which was very similar to the electrotonic
inﬂuence of the adjacent normal HVM in a coupled-cell
system (data not shown), produced the oscillation of rela-
tively small amplitude and low upstroke velocity, as well as
unstable CL and irregular dynamics. The IK,b conductance
(gK,b) range where an EP is unstable and spontaneous
oscillations occur was very limited, with further increases in
gK,b leading to quiescence via emergence of a stable EP. In
contrast, IKr could yield the large amplitude oscillation with

relatively high upstroke velocity and stable CL; however, IKr
caused irregular dynamics at higher gKr values (.31.5 pS/
pF), whereas IKs did not.

We further examined how incorporating the K

currents
affects the structural stability of the reduced model to depo-
larizing or hyperpolarizing loads. The unstable regions in the
Ibias-V0 curve were determined for individual K
currents
with the conductance increased up to 50 pS/pF (data not
shown). Note that the structural stability to hyperpolarizing
or depolarizing loads is considered as improved when the
unstable Ibias region is enlarged, i.e., when larger Ibias is
required to cause a bifurcation to quiescence. The results are
summarized as follows: 1), Increasing IKr (gKr) continuously
enlarged the unstable Ibias region, sufﬁciently improving the
structural stability to depolarizing Ibias; 2), IKs could also
enlarge the unstable Ibias region, but did not improve the
structural stability as efﬁciently as IKr; and 3), IK,b could not
enlarge the Ibias region of instability; with increasing gK,b, the
unstable regions shrunk and ﬁnally disappeared via a codi-
mension two saddle-node bifurcation. These ﬁndings are
essentially the same as those reported for the SA node
pacemaker (see Fig. 9 of Kurata et al. (11)).

DISCUSSION

Mechanisms of BP generation in
IK1-downregulated HVM

Nonlinear dynamical aspects of BP generation

This study shows that pacemaker activity appears in the
IK1-downregulated HVM system via a saddle-node bifurca-
tion (disappearance of a stable EP) or Hopf bifurcation
(destabilization of an EP) and that the instability of an EP at
depolarized potentials underlies the stable HVM pacemak-
ing. The term ‘‘mechanisms of pacemaker generation’’ is
usually interpreted as meaning how individual sarcolemmal
currents drive or contribute to phase 4 depolarization. From
the viewpoint of the nonlinear dynamics and bifurcation
theory, however, ‘‘EP instability’’ seems to be most impor-
tant for the generation of robust pacemaking: if the system
has a stable EP, it will be quiescent at the stable EP or in a
bistable zone where stable steady states and periodic states

points (H1–2, SN1–2), as well as the control V0 at Ibias ¼ 0 (EP1), in the Ibias-V0 curve with decreasing INaCa are shown for the unmodiﬁed system (left) and the

coexist and thus annihilation occurs (for details on bistability
and annihilation, see Landau et al. (6) and Guevara and
Jongsma (8)). When considering the pacemaker mecha-
nisms, therefore, one must elucidate the ionic mechanism of
EP destabilization, which may be different from that of phase
4 depolarization. In the HVM pacemaker, ICa,L is responsible
for EP instability, whereas INaCa as well as IKr deactivation
most contributes to phase 4 depolarization. Our study also
suggests that the question ‘‘which current is dominant dur-
ing phase 4’’ is relevant to the ionic mechanism not for
EP instability as a requisite to stable pacemaking, but for
the regulation of the destabilization rate (Figs. 4, 9, and
10). These viewpoints would be important particularly for
engineering of functional BP cells to exhibit robust pace-
making.

It should be noted that the EP with the most depolarized
potential (EP1) is always unstable, not stabilized during IK1
suppression (Fig. 5). The saddle-node bifurcation may also
be yielded by increasing inward currents such as INa,b or
ICa,b. Nevertheless, increasing the inward currents would not
lead to BP generation, because the positively shifted EP1
becomes stable via a Hopf bifurcation, resulting in an arrest
at depolarized potentials. Another approach to create a BP
cell may be overexpression of the hyperpolarization-acti-
vated current (Ih), which has been reported to induce BP
activity in canine atrial or Purkinje myocytes (52,56). How-
ever, incorporating Ih did not cause a saddle-node bifurcation
nor BP generation in the HVM model with normal IK1,
although accelerating BP generation during IK1 suppression
via shifting the saddle-node bifurcation point toward higher
gK1 values (data not shown). This discrepancy is at least in
part due to the difference in IK1 density, which is much
higher in ventricular cells than in atrial or Purkinje cells
(56,57). These ﬁndings suggest that IK1 downregulation,
ensuring both the occurrence of a saddle-node bifurcation
and instability of EP1, is necessary and sufﬁcient for con-
structing BP cells from HVMs.

Roles of individual sarcolemmal currents in
HVM pacemaking

ICa,L

ICa,L contributes little to the initial phase of pacemaker
depolarization, although it contributes signiﬁcantly to the
terminal phase of the depolarization as well as to phase 0
upstroke (Fig. 4). Nevertheless, ICa,L appears to be in-
dispensable for the HVM pacemaking in that it is responsible
for EP instability as a requisite to stable pacemaking (Figs. 7
and 8). The Ca21
channel responsible for ICa,L in the current
model and original ventricular or SA node models cor-
responds to the high voltage-activated subtype (C-LTCC)
formed by an a1C subunit (Cav1.2), which is a major
component in the heart of mouse or other species (58–60).
However, the low voltage-activated subtype (D-LTCC), the

Biophysical Journal 89(4) 2865–2887

a-subunit of which is a
1D (Cav1.3), activating at the pace-
maker potential range, has recently been reported to con-
tribute to phase 4 depolarization in the mouse SA node
(61–63) and possibly in the rabbit SA node as well (64).
Nevertheless, it is unlikely that D-LTCC plays an important
role in the ventricular pacemaking, because Cav1.3 m-RNA
is not present in the mouse or human ventricle (58,63).

IK

In contrast to ICa,L, IKr or IKs was suggested to be inessential
for EP destabilization leading to spontaneous activity, because
1), eliminating IKr and/or IKs did not signiﬁcantly attenuate
the EP instability as evaluated by positive real parts of ei-
genvalues of Jacobian matrices, little shrinking the unstable
V0 region in the Ibias-V0 curve (Fig. 7); and 2), the IK-
in control (at gK ¼ 0),
removed BP system, quiescent
resumed automaticity when an EP was destabilized by in-
corporation of IK,b (Fig. 8) or electrotonic inﬂuences of ad-
jacent normal HVMs (data not shown). Although IKr or IKs is
not necessarily required for the generation of spontaneous
currents appear to play pivotal roles in
oscillations, the K
the modulation of BP dynamics. As suggested by Fig. 8, IK
would be necessary for the BP generation with large am-
plitude, high upstroke velocity, and stable frequency. Decreas-
ing IKr or IKs shrunk the unstable Ibias region in the Ibias-V0
curve, i.e., it attenuated the structural stability to depolarizing
conductance region,
loads of the BP system (Fig. 7). The K
as well as the Ibias region, where EPs are unstable and thus
spontaneous oscillations occur, was much larger for the
IK-incorporated system than for the IK,b-incorporated system
(Fig. 8). Therefore, IK may also contribute to the robust
maintenance of BP activity, i.e., prevention of a bifurcation
to quiescence.

INaCa

buffering or tentative electroneutral Ca21

As in the guinea pig ventricular pacemaking (3), INaCa was
suggested to be the dominant pacemaker current in the HVM
pacemaking, with its removal leading to cessation of BP
activity via a Hopf bifurcation (Figs. 4 and 9). However, the
stabilization of an EP and cessation of BP activity during
INaCa decreases appear to be a consequence of the Ca21
-
dependent inactivation of ICa,L, rather than the INaCa decrease
itself: when fCa was ﬁxed or when [Ca21
]i was kept low by
rapid Ca21
trans-
port, BP activity did not cease, being quite stable, during
INaCa suppression (Fig. 9). It is also suggested that INaCa is
not required for the destabilization of an EP or generation
of spontaneous oscillations (Fig. 10). Thus, the major role of
INaCa would be the maintenance of relatively low [Ca21
]i to
prevent Ca21
inactivation of ICa,L as well as
cellular remodeling under Ca21
-overload conditions, rather
than the contribution to phase 4 depolarization as a pace-
/Ca21
maker current. In all existing heart models, the Na
exchanger is assumed to mediate only the current INaCa via

to carry a signiﬁcant part of INa,b via the Na

the most dominant pacemaker current in most SA node

Comparisons of HVM pacemaker with other
pacemaker systems

Conditions for BP generation and BP dynamics

Real and model guinea pig ventricular myocytes exhibited
spontaneous activities on 80–81% suppression of IK1 channels
(1,3). In the HVM model, BP activity appeared when IK1 was
suppressed by 84.6%, which is close to the critical values for
BP generation in the guinea pig ventricle. The BP rates of the
IK1-reduced HVM (54–75 bpm), lower than those of the real
or model guinea pig ventricular myocytes (100–164 bpm),
appear to be in reasonable agreement with the mean human
heart rate under normal conditions (refer to Table 4).

Pacemaker mechanisms

It has been reported for the rabbit SA node primary pace-
maker that 1), ICa,L is, but IK is not, responsible for EP
instability leading to spontaneous oscillations (11); 2), IKr
contributes to the robust pacemaking with large amplitude
and stable frequency (11); 3), IKr deactivation is crucial for
phase 4 depolarization (53–55); and 4), INa,b and INaCa are the
predominant inward currents during phase 4 depolarization,
with ICa,L contributing only to the terminal phase of the
depolarization as well as to phase 0 upstroke (51,55). These
ﬁndings for the SA node pacemaker are in good agreement
with our conclusions for the HVM pacemaker. As mentioned
in the preceding section, the low voltage-activated ICa,L
mediated by D-LTCC may serve as a pacemaker current in
the SA node pacemaking, but not in the ventricular pace-
making (61–63). However, the knockout of D-LTCC did not
lead to sinus arrest, but led only to sinus bradycardia and
arrhythmias (61–63), whereas the deletion of C-LTCC caused
fetal death (60). These ﬁndings and our study suggest that the
roles of C-LTCC and D-LTCC in pacemaking are different:
C-LTCC would contribute mainly to EP destabilization as a
requisite for basal pacemaking, whereas D-LTCC is not
necessary for basal pacemaking, rather playing a pivotal role
in pacemaker regulation by contributing mainly to phase 4
depolarization. Thus, the dynamical mechanism of the HVM
pacemaking appears to be essentially the same as that of the
basal SA node pacemaking. This consistency may reﬂect that
cardiac myocytes, both pacemaker and nonpacemaker cells,
in different regions or species share the common mechanism
for the generation of basal pacemaking. Nevertheless, previ-
ous reports suggest the regional difference in pacemaker

mechanisms. Blocking ICa,L abolished spontaneous activity
in central SA node tissues, but not in peripheral tissues
(67,68); in the peripheral SA node, INa might contribute to
EP destabilization and pacemaker generation. Ih is also
suggested to play a predominant role in the subsidiary pace-
maker mechanism (69,70). Bifurcation analyses of mathe-
matical models for various regions or species are required for
further investigations of the regional difference in pacemaker
mechanisms.

Because there is transmural heterogeneity of electrophys-
iological properties of ventricular myocytes (16,18,71), one
may also expect the transmural difference in BP mecha-
nisms. Electrophysiological differences between epicardial,
midmyocardial, and endocardial cells are attributable mainly
to the differences in density and kinetics of Ito or IKs, and
possibly INaCa, as summarized by ten Tusscher et al. (16).
Reducing gto only increased POP without affecting other AP
parameters or EP stability (data not shown). Changing gKs or
INaCa exerted only minor effects on stability and dynamics of
the BP system (Figs. 6, 7, 9, and 10). These results suggest
that bifurcation structures of epicardial, midmyocardial, and
endocardial cells are essentially the same; thus we do not
expect the transmural difference in BP mechanisms.

Responsiveness to b-adrenergic stimulation

As suggested by Silva and Rudy (3), a potential advantage of
the BP over the electronic pacemaker is responsiveness to
b-adrenergic stimulation (ßAS). In the guinea pig ventricular
model, BP responsiveness to ßAS was very limited (3). We
did not show the data on this issue, which is very important
but out of the aim of this study. Nevertheless, we also found
in the simulations according to the method of Silva and Rudy
(3) that the HVM pacemaker did not exhibit a signiﬁcant rate
increase in response to ßAS, suggesting that the ventricular
pacemaker is less sensitive to ßAS than the SA node pace-
maker. The low sensitivity to ßAS of the ventricular pace-
maker may be at least in part due to the lack or low density of
the regulatory inward currents, such as the low voltage-
activated ICa,L, sustained-inward current (Ist) and Ih, which
are known to be enhanced by ßAS and abundant in SA node
primary pacemaker cells (11,51,61–63,72–74).

Signiﬁcance of applying bifurcation theory to
BP system analysis and engineering

In this study, we used stability and bifurcation analyses to
investigate the mechanisms of BP generation. As mentioned
in the Introduction, the nonlinear dynamical approach is
known to be useful for general understanding and systematic
descriptions of the mechanisms of normal and abnormal
pacemaker activities (4–11), as well as reentrant arrhythmias
or conduction block (75–78). This study demonstrates that
bifurcation theory also provides a reliable way of elucidating
the roles of individual currents in pacemaker generation of
IK1-downregulated ventricular myocytes.

Kurata et al.

Our work suggests that exploring bifurcation structures of
model cells can reveal the conditions and ways for oscil-
latory behavior to emerge or disappear in cardiac myocytes
and possibly allow us to accurately predict and properly
control the dynamics of real cells. Thus, the mathematical
approach would also be applicable to engineering BP cells
from native myocytes in vivo (1,52,56) or from human
embryonic stem cells (hESCs) ex vivo (79–81) for the gene
or cell therapy of bradyarrhythmias usually requiring im-
plantation of an electronic pacemaker (for review, see
Gepstein et al. (80)). Bifurcation analyses of model systems
may lead to appropriate design of a functional BP, like the
SA node, as a therapeutic alternative to the electronic pace-
maker. Further investigations based on the bifurcation theory
will possibly ﬁnd out the most efﬁcient ways to 1), create BP
cells, 2), control BP dynamics, 3), improve the robustness of
BP activity as well as BP sensitivity to ßAS, and 4), improve
BP ability to drive surrounding nonpacemaker tissues via
modulating the existing currents or newly expressing the
regulatory inward currents.

Limitations and perspectives of the study

Incompleteness of the HVM model

dynamics, SR Ca21

One limitation of this study is the incompleteness of the
HVM model due to the lack of experimental data from
HVMs. The formulas for ICa,L, IKr, SR Ca21
release, and
others were partly adopted from human atrial or animal heart
models (see also Priebe and Beuckelmann (15)). In addition,
for simplicity, the current model does not incorporate detailed
descriptions of intracellular Ca21
handl-
ing, or the intracellular modulating factors such as cAMP
and protein kinases, as in recently developed models (73,
82–84). More elaborate HVM models have recently been
developed (16,17); however, these models with the larger
number of equations and/or very complex formulas are less
suitable for bifurcation analyses than the current model (for
more details, see Theory and Methods). We believe that the
current model is valuable and highly appropriate for explor-
ing the essential mechanisms of BP generation. Neverthe-
less, further sophisticated but simpliﬁed HVM models with
reﬁnements of the formulas based on the data from HVMs,
as well as incorporating more detailed descriptions of the
intracellular Ca21
handling and modulating factors, would
have to be developed for future investigations.

The recently developed HVM models (16,17) are based
mainly on the data from expressed channels whose electro-
physiological properties may be different from those of
native channels in HVMs. As suggested recently (79,81,
85), hESCs would provide an unlimited and renewable source
of human cardiomyocytes for basic research as well as
implantation therapies. Thus, cell system engineering to
establish hESC-derived experimental models of HVMs may
facilitate the development of more sophisticated HVM
models.

Biophysical Journal 89(4) 2865–2887

Lack of experimental evidence

The conclusions in this study are of course the predictions
from the model system; thus, they must be veriﬁed and sup-
ported by experimental works using real HVMs. However,
there is no experimental study on BP activity in genetically
modiﬁed HVMs. The hESC-derived experimental models of
ventricular or nodal cells may also be useful for future in-
vestigations of BP mechanisms and thus veriﬁcation of the
model predictions. We hope that this study provides a stim-
ulus to further experimentation on this issue.

Requirement of multicellular models involving
electrotonic interactions

As suggested by Silva and Rudy (3), it should be recognized
that the engineering of single BP cells is only a ﬁrst step
toward creation of the functional BP. Pacemaker mecha-
nisms of the intact SA node are reported to involve electro-
tonic interactions with the atrium (86–88). BP cells in vivo
would also suffer hyperpolarizing loads of adjacent non-
pacemaker cells, which may abolish BP activity. Thus, BP
ability to drive the heart would depend on its architecture to
facilitate optimization of the electrical loading by the sur-
rounding atrial or ventricular tissue (86,87). Recently, hESC-
derived pacemaking cardiomyocytes implanted into the
guinea pig ventricle in vivo have been found to integrate
with the host tissue via forming gap junctions and drive the
quiescent ventricle with nearly the same rate as in the iso-
lated state (81). This suggested that the engrafted BP could
efﬁciently interact with the surrounding nonpacemaker tissue
to minimize the electrotonic load. However,
the hESC-
derived pacemaker may not be as robust to excessive hy-
perpolarizing loads as the native SA node pacemaker.
Multicellular models such as for
the SA node tissue
(68,86,89) are required for further investigating the roles of
electrotonic interactions in BP mechanisms in vivo and how
to create a real functional BP with robust pacemaking.

The mathematical expressions used in this study are given below. Units are
mV, pA, nS, ms, nF, mM, and L. The temperature assumed for the model is
37°C. The symbols used and their deﬁnitions are the same as those in our
rabbit SA node model (51) or the original PB model (15). The stimulus
current Istim in Eqs. 55 and 64 was assumed to carry K
ions into the cell
for charge conservation during paced AP simulations, being set equal to zero
for BP simulations. Standard parameter values and initial conditions for
computations are given in Tables 5 and 6, respectively.

]rel, and [Ca21

To determine an EP (resting state) of the HVM system as initial conditions
for AP simulations, steady-state values of the state variables V, [Ca21
]i,
]up were calculated numerically by the
[Na
differential or algebraic method of Hund et al. (35). Differential equations
given in Appendix 1 (Eqs. 55, 60–64) were used for the differential method
with the MATLAB ODE solvers, whereas the following algebraic equations
derived from the differential equations were used for the algebraic method
with a nonlinear equation solver available in MATLAB.

The symbol C0 in Eq. 71 is a constant of integration determined by initial
conditions (35). Note that Eq. 65 can be derived from Eqs. 66, 69, and 70 (see
]i
Eqs. 43–46). The algebraic method for the full system with variable [K
practically used Eqs. 66–70 and Eqs. 71–73 instead of Eq. 65, assuming that
]i is equal to 140 mM under control conditions (e.g., at gK1 ¼ 1). The
[K
differential and algebraic methods yielded nearly identical results. For BP
]i-ﬁxed system, steady-
simulations and bifurcation analyses using the [K
state values of the state variables were calculated by Eqs. 65–69.
