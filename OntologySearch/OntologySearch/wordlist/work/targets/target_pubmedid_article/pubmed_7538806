ABSTRACT A model of the cardiac ventricular action potential that accounts for dynamic changes in ionic concentrations was
used to study the mechanism, characteristics, and rate dependence of early afterdepolarizations (EADs). A simulation approach
to the study of the effects of pharmacological agents on cellular processes was introduced. The simulation results are qualitatively
consistent with experimental observations and help resolve contradictory conclusions in the literature regarding the mechanism
of EADs. Our results demonstrate that: 1) the L-type calcium current, /ca' is necessary as a depolarizing charge carrier during
an EAD; 2) recovery and reactivation of /Ca is the mechanism of EAD formation, independent of the intervention used to induce
the EADs (cesium, Bay K 8644, or isoproterenol were used in our simulations, following similar published experimental pro-
tocols); 3) high [Ca2+]i is not required for EADs to develop and calcium release by the sarcoplasmic reticulum does not occur
during the EAD; 4) although the primary mechanism of EAD formation is recovery of 'ca' other plateau currents can modulate
EAD formation by affecting the balance of currents during a conditional phase before the EAD take-off; and 5) EADs are present
at drive cycle lengths longer than 1000 ms. Because of the very long activation time constant of the delayed rectifier potassium
current, 'K' the activation gate of /K does not deactivate completely between consecutive stimuli at fast rates (drive cycle length
< 1000 ms). As a result, /K plays a key role in determining the rate dependence of EADs.

INTRODUCTION
An early afterdepolarization (EAD) is defined (Cranefield
and Aronson, 1988) as a depolarizing afterpotential that be-
gins before the completion of repolarization of an action
potential. It is believed that EADs may contribute to the
polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients with
the long QT syndrome that manifests as Torsade de Pointes
in the electrocardiogram (Hiraska et al., 1992; January
and Moscucci,

bradycardia-related and are associated with slow pacing or
a long pause (Cranefield and Aronson, 1988; Damiano and
Rosen, 1984; Rosen, 1990).

1992). EAD-induced arrhythmias

EADs are divided into two types according to the phase
of the action potential during which the EAD occurs
(Cranefield and Aronson, 1988). We are interested in EADs
that develop at plateau potentials. EADs were induced ex-
perimentally in several studies by exposure to different phar-
macological interventions. However, as summarized below
and presented in Fig. 1, because of experimental limitations
such as lack of specificity of drug actions and inability to
measure directly certain ionic currents and concentration
changes (e.g., the calcium transient), conclusions regarding
the mechanism of EADs are conflicting and not conclusive.
Exposing the ferret ventricular muscle to cesium, Marban
et al. (1986) found that EADs induced by cesium (Fig. LA)
were neither abolished by administration of ryanodine, an

inhibitor of Ca2" release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum
(SR), nor by loading the cell with BAPTA (a calcium chelator).
They concluded that the formation of EADs does not require
elevated intracellular free Ca2+ or calcium release from the SR.
Instead, they suggested that EAD generation involves Ca" entry
through the sarcolemma L-type channels.

January and his colleagues (January et al., 1988; January
and Riddle, 1989) studied the mechanism of EADs induced
by Bay K 8644 in sheep and canine cardiac Purkinje fibers
(Fig. 1B). Two-pulse and two-step voltage clamp protocols
were used in their studies. On the basis of their observations,
they suggested that induction of EADs required two pro-
cesses: 1) prolongation of the action potential plateau and 2)
recovery of the Ca21 current through the L-type channels to
carry the depolarizing charge for EAD formation. Their later
experimental and mathematical modeling studies further
supported the central role of the L-type calcium window
current in EAD development (Hirano et al., 1992; January
et al., 1991; Shorofsky and January, 1992).

Contrary to the L-type calcium current hypothesis pre-
sented above, Priori and Corr (1990) proposed that EADs and
delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) shared the same
mechanism (Fig. 1C). With the administration of isoproter-
enol, both EADs and DADs were induced. Both could be
abolished by ryanodine, by lowering extracellular sodium
concentration or by benzamil (a blocker of the sodium-
calcium exchange current, INa.)* Therefore, they concluded
that a transient inward current (possibly INac), activated by
calcium release from the SR, carried the depolarizing charge
for both EADs and DADs.

In this paper, we use a recently developed mathematical
model of the cardiac ventricular action potential (the L-R
model) (Luo and Rudy, 1994a, b) to study the mechanism of
EADs. We take advantage of the ability to manipulate and

channel currents, represented mathematically by a Hodgkin-Huxley type of
formalism, as well as ionic pumps and exchangers. In addition, processes
that regulate ionic concentration changes, especially dynamic changes of
intracellular calcium concentration, are also introduced. A diagram of the
cell model is provided in Fig. 2. A detailed table of equations governing
the model is provided in Luo and Rudy (1994a).

Although the simulations presented here are based on the L-R model,
minor adjustments are introduced for the purpose of the particular simu-
lations conducted in this study. It is well known that release of calcium
stored in the SR can be triggered by the process of calcium-induced calcium
release (CICR) (Fabiato, 1983, 1985). In the model (Luo and Rudy, 1994a),
CICR occurs if total [Ca2+]i (i.e., free plus buffered) increases by more than
0.18 ,M in the first 2 ms of the action potential. After a delay of 3-9 ms
from the beginning of a stimulus that generates an action potential, free
cytoplasmic [Ca2+]i begins to increase quickly as a result of SR release and
reaches its peak value in an additional 8-19 ms (Cleeman and Morad, 1991).
During this process, the distribution of free calcium ions in the myoplasm
is relatively homogeneous (Takamatsu and Weir, 1989). In the L-R model,
this peak is reached 10 ms after the junctional SR (JSR) begins to release
its stored calcium. In our simulations, this interval is prolonged to 15 ms
(within the 8-19 ms range) by increasing the activation and deactivation
time constants of SR calcium release channels from 2 to 3.5 ms. This slower
kinetics approximates more accurately the experimental recordings of the
time course of the calcium transient (Cleeman and Morad, 1991). We also
adjust the maximal rate constant of calcium release from the JSR from 60
to 38 ms-1 to obtain a peak Ca2" transient value of 1.0 ,LM during a normal
action potential, as reported experimentally (Leblanc and Hume, 1990).
Calcium can also be released from the JSR spontaneously when the cell
is calcium overloaded (Stern et al., 1988). This property is incorporated in
the L-R model (Luo and Rudy, 1994a). Heterogeneous calcium distribution
in the myoplasm is observed during the spontaneous release process
(Grouselle et al., 1991) and the average calcium transient reaches its peak
later compared with the calcium transient generated by the CICR process.
In the L-R model, all SR release sites are lumped into a single location. To
reflect the longer time course of the average calcium transient during spon-
taneous calcium release, we increase the release channel activation and
deactivation time constants from 2 to 6 ms under these conditions. The
maximal rate constant is decreased from 4 to 3 ms-1.

In several of our simulations, the cells were paced relatively fast for
extended periods of time. Therefore, an extracellular cleft is added to the
L-R model to take into account the possibility of ion accumulation in the cleft.

(A) Marban et al [43]. EADs were induced when ventricular fibers were
exposed to CsCl and then returned to normal Tyrode solution. Addition of
ryanodine or BAPTA did not remove EADs. They concluded that high

L-type channels plays an important role. (B) January et al [29,30]. In the
presence of Bay K 8644, EADs were induced at 3.5 mM [K+]. but not at

tocols, they concluded that recovery of L-type channels from inactivation

study the behavior of individual ionic processes in the
mathematical model of the complex and highly interactive
cellular system. The effects of cesium, isoproterenol, and
Bay K 8644 that were used in the above experiments to in-
duce EADs are simulated in an attempt to resolve the con-
troversy regarding the mechanism underlying EAD forma-
tion. In addition, we study the rate dependence of EAD
generation and investigate its ionic channel mechanism.
These studies were presented, in part, in an abstract form
(Zeng and Rudy, 1994a, b).

SIMULATION METHODS
To study the mechanism of EADs, the effects of cesium, Bay K 8644, and
isoproterenol, which are known to induce EADs experimentally, are simu-
lated by using the L-R model (Luo and Rudy, 1994a, b). In this model, the
guinea pig type of ventricular action potential is numerically constructed on
the basis of experimental data. Included in the model are the membrane ionic

Following Rasmusson et al. (1990), we compute the concentration change ofions
in the cleft as the balance of two processes, transmembrane ionic current flow
and diffusion between the cleft and the bulk medium. A diffusion time constant
of 1000 ms was used. Details are provided in Rasmusson et al. (1990).

As mentioned above, the effects of cesium, Bay K 8644, and isoprot-
erenol were simulated to induce EADs in our theoretical studies. The effects
of these three drugs and their representation in our simulated protocols are
discussed below.

Cesium
Cesium is known to depolarize the resting potential and flatten the plateau
of the action potential (Isenberg, 1976). The pacemaker current, If, can be
blocked by Cs' at very low Cs' concentrations (down to 0.1 mM) (Isenberg,
1976). IK and IK1 can also be blocked by extracellular Cs' (Harvey and
Ten Eick, 1989; Meier and Kalzung, 1981). However, high Cs' concen-
tration (5 mM) is needed to reduce these two currents. The Cs' block of K+
currents is both voltage and concentration dependent (Meier and Katzung,
1981; Toumeur et al., 1987). To simulate these effects, we introduce a
voltage- and concentration-dependent gate, 8c, to account for the Cs'
modulation of the IK and IK1 conductances in the L-R model. To fit the
experimental recordings (Meier and Katzung, 1981; Toumeur et al., 1987),
SB, is expressed as

Scs = 1/(1 + exp((V - V,12)IKc,))

(1)
where V is the membrane potential, KCS is -16 mV, and V1,2 is a
concentration-dependent parameter. At 5 and 10 mM Cs', V,/2 is set to -95
and -40 mV, respectively.

Bay K 8644
Bay K 8644 can be divided into two types according to its optical isomers:
the (+) isomer of Bay K 8644, which shows properties of a calcium L-type
channel antagonist, and the (-) isomer of Bay K 8644, which is primarily
an L-type Ca2` channel agonist (Frankowiak et al., 1985). In this study, we
are interested in the (-) isomer of Bay K 8644 at 1 ,uM concentration. Bay
K 8644 is a 1,4-dihydropyridine that can increase the microscopic Ca2+
currents by prolonging the mean open time of single L-type channels (Hess
et al., 1984). At a concentration of 1 ,uM, the enhancement of the L-type
Ca2+ channel current reaches its maximum. It is generally observed that the
steady state activation and inactivation curves are shifted toward hyperpo-
larization potentials by Bay K 8644 and the time constants for both acti-
vation and inactivation are accelerated in the presence of Bay K 8644. There
are many published studies describing the effects of Bay K 8644 on the
kinetics of the L-type Ca2+ channel (Hadley and Lederer, 1992; Markwardt
and Nilius, 1988; Sanguinetti et al., 1986). Because of species differences
and differences in the experimental protocols, the results of the different
studies are not in complete agreement (Sanguinetti et al., 1986; Markwardt
and Nileus, 1988; Kass, 1987; Hadley and Lederer, 1992, Tiaho et al., 1990).
Our simulations of Bay K 8644 effects on the L-type current mostly follow
the measurements by January et al. (1988) as our objective is to simulate
their experimental protocols. In the presence of 1 ,uM Bay K 8644, the
maximal permeability ofIlc is enhanced threefold. The V,,2 of the activation
curve of the L-type channel is shifted from -10 to -17.5 mV to reflect the
measured 7.5-mV shift of the I-V curve in January et al. (1988). The ac-
tivation time constant Td at all potentials is reduced by 11%. A 10-mV shift
in the negative direction of the steady state inactivation curve, f,, of 'ca is
introduced. A similar shift is applied to the time constant curve Tf of this
process. In addition, its values at all potentials are reduced by 5% to reflect
the acceleration of inactivation of Ic. in the presence of Bay K 8644. The
I-V curve of the L-type channel current was computed before and after
the simulated effects of Bay K 8644. Simulated behavior is consistent with
the experimental observations (January et al., 1988).

Isoproterenol
Isoproterenol is a 13-adrenergic agonist. It is known to increase heart rate and
to enhance contraction (Gadsby, 1984). By binding to the 13-adrenoceptors

to activate a particular type of G protein, the agonist can exert multiple
effects on cardiac cells. These include enhancement of calcium and potas-
sium channel currents, increased calcium uptake ability of the SR, and
modulation of the sodium current and the Na/K pump. Isoproterenol effects
on individual processes are described below.

L-type calcium channel
,B-adrenergic agents such as isoproterenol enhance the L-type calcium chan-
nel current but have no effect on the T-type calcium channel current (Tytgat
et al., 1988; Bean, 1985). The enhancement of Ic. depends on the isopro-
terenol concentration (Trautwein et al., 1987). The threshold, half-maximal,
and maximal isoproterenol concentrations are 0.02, 0.2, and 1.0 ,uM,
respectively.

Studies on single channels (Bean et al., 1984; Ochi and Kawashima,
1990; Tsien et al., 1986) have shown that the unitary current amplitude of
a single channel remained unchanged with the addition of 83-adrenergic
agents. Channel openings were prolonged and channel closing was abbre-
viated. The number of functional channels increased severalfold in the pres-
ence of a 13-adrenergic agent. This increase was species dependent, bringing
about an enhancement of the L-type current in the range of 1.5 to 8 fold in
whole cell recordings.

To simulate the effects of isoproterenol on the calcium current in a
Hodgkin-Huxley type formalism, many investigators suggested simple scal-
ing of the magnitude of Ic. This adjustment is adequate when guinea pig
myocytes are considered. However, a negative shift along the voltage axis
of the L-type I-V curve and a shift of voltage-dependent activation and
inactivation were observed in other species such as frog, rabbit, and rat
cardiac cells (Rosen et al., 1990; Bean, 1984; Tiaho et al., 1991). In addition,
deceleration of inactivation was also found (Tiaho et al., 1991).

Studies of EADs induced by isoproterenol were performed in isolated
canine ventricular cells by Priori and Corr (1990). Detailed published studies
of the effects of f3-adrenergic agents on canine ventricular myocytes could
not be found. In our simulations of the effects of isoproterenol on dog
ventricular cells (the choice of a canine cell is dictated by the Priori and Corr
study that we are trying to simulate), we do not introduce shifts of the
voltage-dependent activation and inactivation curves. The inactivation time
constant is increased by 13%. A fivefold increase of the maximal conduc-
tance is adopted, on the basis of observations ofTseng et al. (1987) in canine
ventricular cells.

As to the modulation of Ca2+-dependent inactivation of the L-type cur-
rent by (3-adrenergic agents, uncertainties still remain. It is well accepted that
both voltage- and Ca2+-dependent inactivation exist in cardiac myocytes.
Recent studies with gating current by Hadley and Lederer (1991a, b) sug-
gested that Ca2+- and voltage-dependent processes inactivate the L-type
channels through independent mechanisms. However, the mechanism un-
derlying the Ca2+-dependent inactivation is still not completely understood
(Standon and Stanfield, 1982; Armstrong and Eckert, 1987; Nunoki et al.,
1989; Trautwein et al., 1987; Ono and Trautwein, 1991; Kameyama
et al., 1986). Independent of the mechanism, isoproterenol clearly reduces
Ca2+-dependent inactivation. To simulate Ca2+-dependent inactivation in
the presence of 1 ,uM isoproterenol in cardiac cells, the half-point concen-
tration for the Ca2+-dependent inactivation (fc1) formulation in the L-R
model is increased from 0.7 to 0.9 ,uM. In addition, we set a non-zero
minimum value of0.03 forfc. to insure that even a very large value of [Ca21]
does not fully close the L-type channels in the presence of isoproterenol.
This modulation is based on the observation by Hadley and Lederer (1991a)
that Ca21 current was still prominent when intracellular Ca2' rose so high
as to cause irreversible contraction of the cell. The formulation offc. after
the modulation by isoproterenol is expressed as follows:

fc = 0.03 + 0.97/(1 + ([Ca2+]i/0.9 X 10-3)3)

Delayed rectifier potassium channel

IK' can be enhanced by a
,B-adrenergic agonist [60,68], but the inward rectifier potassium current, IKI'
is not (Godsby, 1984). Temperature dependence of ,3-adrenergic modulation

of the potassium current was observed (Walsh et al., 1988, 1989). Over the
range of 20-37°C, the isoproterenol-mediated increase of IK was very tem-
perature dependent with a 2.5-fold increase at 37°C. In the presence of
isoproterenol, a 7-15 mV shift in the hyperpolarization direction of the
half-maximal potential of the IK activation curve was observed (Giles et al.,
1989; Duchatell-Gourdov et al., 1989). The time constant of the decay of
IK at repolarization after depolarization increased 10%. Decrease of the
activation time constant and increase of the deactivation time constant were
also observed by Giles et al. (1989).

In the L-R model, the conductance of IK is regulated by two gates, a
voltage-dependent inactivation gate xi and a voltage- and time-dependent
activation gate, x. To simulate the effects of 1 ,uM isoproterenol at 35-37°C,
we shift the activation curve 8 mV in the hyperpolarization direction and
also increase the maximal conductance by a factor of 2. The time constant
for activation is also shifted 8 mV in the negative direction to reflect a
1.1-fold increase in deactivation time relative to control at -30 mV.

Calcium uptake by the SR
In the presence of a ,3-adrenergic agonist, faster relaxation after stronger
contraction was observed [3]. As it is mostly Ca2" uptake by the SR that
lowers [Ca2+]i in the myoplasm, this observation suggests an enhanced Ca2"
uptake ability by the SR. This hypothesis was supported by the observations
of LePench and Demaille (1989) and Gasser et al. (1988). Using isolated
rat ventricular cell preparations, in the presence of 1 ALM isoproterenol,
Kurikara and Konishi (1987) observed a threefold increase of peak calcium
transient and a 30-40% increase in the rate of calcium decay. Okazaki et al.
(1990) observed similar effects. They also observed that a shorter time was
needed to reach the peak calcium transient. In our simulation, we increase
by 41% the maximal uptake rate (Iup) of Ca2+ by the network sarcoplasmic
reticulum (NSR) to simulate these effects of isoproterenol.

Na/K pump
The Na/K pump current is influenced by extracellular and intracellular Na+,
K+, and Ca2" and also by the membrane potential (Rosen et al., 1990). The
effects of isoproterenol on the pump are controversial (Rosen et al., 1990;
Desilets et al., 1986). Recent studies by Gao et al. (1992) documented cal-
cium concentration-dependent modulation of the pump current by isopro-
terenol. For [Ca2+]i >0.1 ,uM, IN.K increased and saturated at 1.0 ,uM [Ca2+]i
to a value that was 23% higher than control. For [Ca21]i <0.1 I'M, IJNK
decreased and saturated at 0.01 ,uM [Ca21]i to a value that was 21% smaller
than control. In our model, to simplify the simulation, a 20% increase of the
maximal pump current (INa) is introduced to reflect the (3-adrenoceptor
stimulation of the Na/K pump. We do not consider a reduction of IN,K as
our simulations involve pacing at fast rates that results in calcium accu-
mulation and a high [Ca2+];.

Sodium channel
Our simulations of isoproterenol effects on IN. are mostly on the basis of
recent studies by Ono et al. (1989). At 1 ,uM isoproterenol, they observed
a 3.4 ± 0.8 mV shift of the inactivation curve ofINa in the hyperpolarization
direction. In their studies they assumed that there was only one inactivation
process of IN.. It is generally accepted that two (fast and slow) processes
control IN. inactivation. In our simulations, we assume that both inactivation
gates are shifted by 3.4 mV in the hyperpolarization direction.

formation of DADs (Cranefield and Aronson, 1988). As both
EADs and DADs are membrane depolarizations that are not
directly caused by external stimulation, the question arises
whether an increase in intracellular Ca2" and spontaneous
calcium release from the SR are also involved in the induc-
tion of EADs. To address this question, we induce EADs by
simulating the effects of cesium on the membrane currents
(Fig. 3). EADs induced by cesium were observed experi-
mentally by many researchers (Marban et al., 1986; Bailie
et al., 1988; Kadesa and Zipes, 1990). Our simulations follow
the experimental protocols of Marban et al. (Marban et al.,
1986). In the presence of 10 mM cesium and 2 mM [Ca2+]0,
an EAD with an amplitude of 3 mV is observed in the simu-
lations (not shown). The action potential duration is pro-
longed from 260 ms under control conditions to 900 ms after
exposure to cesium. In Fig. 3, the effect of cesium at a con-
centration between 5 and 10 mM is simulated (the half-
maximal potential, V112, of Sc, gate is set to -80 mV). In
addition, [Ca2+]
is doubled to 4 mM. An action potential of
830 ms duration with an EAD of 17 mV amplitude is ob-
served (Fig. 3A). These results are consistent with the
observations of Marban et al. and demonstrate that EADs can

be induced by cesium at both normal and relatively high
[Ca2"]. in our model.
To lower the intracellular Ca2" transient during the action
potential, ryanodine and BAPTA were administered in the
experiments of Marban et al. Ryanodine is an alkaloid that
inhibits Ca2" release from the SR by depleting the calcium
storage in the SR at low concentrations. In the simulations,
we represent the reduction of SR Ca2" release as a 90%
reduction of the maximal rate constant of the JSR Ca2" re-
lease current, Grel. (Note that we do not simulate the process
of calcium depletion but only its outcome in terms of reduced
calcium release.) In the presence of 10 mM cesium, 4 mM
[Ca2+]0, and Ore, reduced by 90%, four oscillations (EADs)
of the membrane potential are observed during the repolar-
ization phase (Fig. 3B). Compared with the behavior without
any interventions that alter SR release (Fig. 3A), the SR cal-
cium release current, 'rel' is a substantially smaller as a result
of the reduced Grel (Fig. 3B). The calcium transient that is
generated under the condition of reduced Grel is also smaller
(Fig. 3B) and results mostly from Ca2" entry through the
L-type channels. However, EADs are still present.

A different method of reducing the intracellular free cal-
cium concentration is by loading the cell with BAPTA.
BAPTA is a Ca2" chelator that increases the Ca2"-buffering
capacity of the cell. In the simulations, we introduce BAPTA
as a third myoplasmic buffer in addition to troponin and
calmodulin. Its buffering action is represented by the fol-
lowing equation:

[BAPTA] = [BAPTA] X {a2+]ij +B[Ca2]rA}

+[Ca~

(3)

where [BAPTA] is the concentration of BAPTA that binds
calcium, [BAPTA] is the total BAPTA concentration in the
myoplasm, and Km BAfA is 0.215 ,uM based on measurements
by Harrison and Bers (1987). In the presence of 1.7 mM
BAPTA, 4 mM [Ca2+]L, and 10 mM Cs+, EADs are present
(Fig. 3C). No calcium release from the SR is observed as the
increase in intracellular free Ca2+ is not sufficient to induce
SR release. As in the previous simulation (Fig. 3B), the
[Ca2+]i increase is also caused by Ca2+ entry through the
L-type channels. Despite the small [Ca2+]i transient, EADs
are still present.

The simulation results presented in Fig. 3 demonstrate that
Ca2+ release from the SR is not necessary for EADs to de-
velop and that EADs can be formed in the absence of calcium
overload. Therefore, in contrast to DADs, calcium overload
and spontaneous release of calcium from the SR are not the
basis for the development of EADs.

The role of the L-type calcium current in
EAD formation
It is widely accepted that a transient inward current, 'ti, at
resting potential causes DADs. This current is carried by the
Na'-Ca2+ exchanger or, in some cases such as calcium over-
load, by an additional current through a nonspecific calcium-
activated channel (Luo and Rudy, 1994b). In contrast, a con-

as

exists

to which current carries

troversy
the
depolarizing charge that causes the secondary depolarization
during an action potential, leading to an EAD. To address this
question, we simulate the experimental protocols of January
et al. (January et al., 1988; January and Riddle, 1989) in
which Bay K 8644 was used to induce EADs. With the simu-
lated intervention of 1 ,uM Bay K 8644, an EAD is induced
(Fig. 4A). Accompanying the secondary depolarization is a
reversal of the direction of change of ICa that stops decreasing
in magnitude and increases in the inward direction, display-
ing a negative hump during the EAD (Fig. 4B, arrow 1). Fig.
4C shows that this behavior of Ica is caused by reactivation
of the d-gate, which determines the activation kinetics of the
L-type calcium channel, from its deactivation state (Fig. 4C,
arrow 3). The inactivation f-gate and fc-gate represent the
voltage- and calcium-dependent inactivation processes of the
calcium channel, respectively. Recovery of both inactivation
gates from their inactivation state is observed before the EAD
depolarization (Fig. 4C). The dynamics of their recovery and
their role in EAD development will be discussed in the next
section, in conjunction with the conditional phase that pre-
cedes the EAD. The Na'-Ca2" exchange current, INaCa' re-
verses its outward-to-inward trend before the EAD take-off
and changes from inward to outward during the EAD de-
polarization phase (Fig. 4D, arrow 2). IK and the total time-
independent current, Iv (Fig. 4, C and D, respectively) also
become more outward at the EAD depolarization phase.

'Na (not shown) remains zerojust before, during, and after the
EAD. Therefore in the simulations of EADs induced by Bay
K 8644, 'Ca is the only current that increases in the inward
direction during the EAD depolarization phase and develops
a larger inward magnitude during the EAD than during
normal, uninterrupted repolarization. INac., although mostly
inward during the EAD depolarization phase, is of small
magnitude. In fact, following its voltage-dependence char-
acteristics, it becomes less inward as a result of the EAD
depolarization and contributes less depolarizing current than
in the absence of the EAD. All of the other currents become
more outward during the same period and, in fact, provide
more repolarizing currents at the EAD depolarization phase
than when an EAD is not generated, counteracting the de-
polarization process that is supported by ICa. Similar behavior
is also observed in the simulations when EADs are induced
by cesium or by isoproterenol.

As stated above, Ica is the only current that increases in the
inward (depolarizing) direction during the EAD depolariza-
tion phase and that develops a larger inward magnitude in the
presence of an EAD than in its absence. INaCa' on the other
hand, reduces its inward magnitude and becomes outward at
the end of the EAD depolarization phase. However, it is still
inward during most of this phase. To evaluate the importance
of these inward currents to the depolarization process that
generates the EAD, we conducted the following simulations.
The reactivation and inward increase of 'Ca were prevented
by clamping its magnitude at a constant value from the time
when secondary depolarization began in the absence of an I
clamp. As shown in Fig. 5A, fast secondary depolarization
does not occur when Ic. reactivation is prevented. In contrast,
if INaCa is clamped to zero starting at the same time (Fig. 5B)
and no clamp is imposed on Ica, fast secondary depolarization
and an EAD develop. We conclude that Ic. is essential as a
depolarizing charge carrier for the secondary depolarization
and EAD development. In contrast, 'NaCa is not necessary for
carrying the depolarizing charge for EAD development.

January and Riddle (1989) studied the role played by Ica
in EAD development using a two-step voltage clamp pro-
tocol. This protocol is simulated by our computer model as
shown in Fig. 6. When the cell is released from the two-step
voltage clamp, the membrane depolarizes and a hump similar
in morphology to an EAD is produced. This EAD amplitude,
measured from the second voltage step (V.c), is larger at more
negative V. (V.c = -20 mV and Vs, = -50 mV are shown
in Fig. 6A). Fig. 6D shows the EAD amplitude as a function
of V.c (solid circles). The simulated increase of the EAD
magnitude as V.c is held at more negative potentials is con-
sistent with January and Riddle's experimental observation.
Our results also show that the EAD amplitude is dominated
by 'Ca the magnitude of which is much larger than that of
INaCa In Fig. 6, B and C, Ic. and INaCa are compared at two
different Vsc,-20 and -50 mV. At V. of -50 mV, Ica has
a magnitude that is about six times larger than at V__ of -20
mV (Fig. 6B). The larger Ica is associated with an EAD am-

plitude that is approximately four times larger (Fig. 6A). In
contrast, INaCa is more outward at -50 mV (Fig. 6C), coun-
teracting the increase in the EAD amplitude. In Fig. 6D, we
show the EAD amplitude and peak Ica magnitude as a func-
tion of V.c. Both have a similar dependence on Vs,, which also
suggests that the increase in Ic. is responsible for the larger
EAD amplitude at more negative Vs.
In conclusion, our simulations demonstrate that secondary
reactivation during the plateau of the L-type calcium current
is necessary for EAD formation. During the EAD depolar-
ization phase, Ica is essential as a depolarizing charge carrier
and a larger ICa is associated with a larger EAD. INaCa is not
necessary for EAD depolarization. Other currents become
more outward during the EAD, countering secondary depo-
larization and EAD development.

Effects of calcium and potassium currents during
the EAD conditional phase
A delay of repolarization during the plateau of the action
potential is generally observed when an EAD develops.
January et al. introduced the concept of an EAD conditional
phase defined as the repolarization phase before the EAD
occurs. During this phase, the total transmembrane ionic cur-
rent (Io) is small and outward. Ica and IK are two major
time-dependent currents present during this phase, before the

EAD take-off. Using the L-R model, we investigated the
behavior of these two currents during the EAD conditional
phase.

Ica is an inward current whereas IK is a repolarizing (out-
ward) current. The magnitudes of both currents increase and
then decrease during the repolarization phase of a normal
action potential. In the previous sections, we have demon-
strated that cesium can induce EADs by reducing the outward
K+ current and Bay K 8644 can induce EADs by enhancing
the inward Ca2" current. Either intervention results in a net
transmembrane inward current and creates conditions that
are favorable for an EAD to develop. In contrast, EADs can
be removed by reducing inward currents or enhancing out-
ward currents. The simulations in Fig. 7 demonstrate that
application of Bay K 8644 to an extracellular solution that
contains 3.5 mM K+ induces an EAD in the cell model (Fig.
7A, left panel). If [K+]. is increased from 3.5 to 5.4 mM, the
EAD is removed (Fig. 7A, right panel). IK and IKi are known
to be [K+]o dependent, a property that is simulated in our
model. At high [K+]O, the conductances ofthese two channels

constant outward currents of different magnitudes as marked under the fig-
ure are applied to the cell. EADs are abolished with a sufficiently large
outward current (right column, 0.4 pA/4&F). (C) At 5.4 mM [K+]0, constant

increase, resulting in an increase of these outward currents
and acceleration of repolarization. Even when [K+]. is main-
tained at 3.5 mM, the EAD can be removed by applying a
constant outward current of sufficient magnitude (>0.4 ,uA/
,uF; Fig. 7B). EAD is not induced by Bay K 8644 at 5.4 mM
[K+]0. However, if a constant inward current is applied to the
cell (Fig. 7C), the duration of the action potential increases
with the magnitude of this current and EAD is induced when
this current is sufficiently large (>0.7 ,Al,F). The above
simulation results are consistent with the experimental ob-
servations of January et al. [30]. It is important to note that
the applied current used to induce or remove EADs is less
than 0.7 uA/,uF in magnitude. This value is quite small com-
pared with ICa and IK (range, from 3 to 8 ,gA/paF) but falls
within the range of INaCa. The results demonstrate that small
changes in It.,,, during the conditional phase can affect the
formation or removal of EADs.

By exposing the ventricular cell to cesium, EADs are in-
duced (Fig. 8A) as was demonstrated before (see Fig. 3). If

The effects of reduction of Ic. on EAD formation. EADs are
FIGURE 8
induced by the simulated effects of cesium as shown in Fig. 3A. The maximal
conductance of Ic is reduced by different percentages as indicated in the
figure. EAD is removed when a 40% block is applied.

the maximal conductance of ICa is reduced to different de-
grees (from 80 to 60% of its maximal value), the duration of
the action potential decreases gradually with increasing
blockade of Ica (Fig. 8, B-D) and the EAD disappears when
the 'Ca conductance is reduced to 60% of its maximal value.
We conclude that reduction of 'Ca accelerates repolarization
during the conditional phase and creates conditions that do
not favor EAD formation. However, once EADs are induced,
the basic behavior of Ic and other currents and their con-
tribution to EADs are the same as shown in Fig. 4.

The slowing and delay of repolarization during the EAD
conditional phase were observed in the above two simula-
tions. A related question is how prolongation of the plateau
enhances EAD formation. To address this question, we ex-
amine kinetic processes of the L-type channel (d-gate.f-gate,
andfc -gate) when EAD is induced by Bay K 8644 (Fig. 4C;
Ca is shown in Fig. 4B). After the initial inactivation caused
by depolarization and [Ca2+]i increase, both inactivation
gates, f-gate and fCa-gate, gradually recover at a relatively

slow rate with repolarization. This process is also observed
during normal repolarization without an EAD (demonstrated
by the L-R model (Luo and Rudy, 1994a)). Unlike the in-
activation gates, the activation d-gate of the L-type channel
has a very fast time constant. To a good approximation, its
time dependence can be neglected during the repolarization
phase of the action potential. Hence the value of d is basically
determined by the membrane potential. After its fast initial
activation at the beginning of the action potential, the d-gate
deactivates with repolarization. At the EAD take-off poten-
tial range, the d-gate is not fully deactivated. With the delay
andfCa are allowed longer recovery time
of repolarization,
and attain a state of greater reactivation. Therefore, when the
membrane repolarizes to the same potential level at a slower
rate, the conductance of the L-type Ica at this potential is
larger than that during repolarization at a normal rate. Hence,
with delayed repolarization, more inward current is produced
by Ica at the conditional phase, leading to conditions that
favor EAD formation.

The important conclusions regarding the effects of Ica and
IK during the conditional phase for EAD formation can be
summarized as follows: 1) increase of Ic. or decrease of IK
during the conditional phase helps conditions for EAD to
develop; 2) a small change in total transmembrane ionic cur-
rent during the conditional phase is sufficient to influence
EAD formation; and 3) slowing and delay of repolarization
during the conditional phase allow longer time for Ica to
recover from inactivation, which in turn results in a larger
inward transmembrane current contributed by 'Ca' leading to
conditions that favor EAD formation. We observe that small
changes in the membrane current during the conditional
phase can greatly influence EAD formation. These obser-
vations demonstrate the delicate balance between currents
that exists during the action potential plateau and the high
sensitivity to small changes during this phase.

Role of Na-Ca exchange current during the EAD
conditional phase
Two reasons motivate us to investigate the effects of INaCa on
the conditional phase and its role in the development of
EADs. The first reason is that the magnitude of the added
current needed to induce or remove EADs is small and falls
in the range of the 'NaCa magnitude. This was demonstrated
previously (Fig. 7). The second reason is the hypothesis of
Priori and Corr (1990) that EADs share the same mechanism
as DADs, namely spontaneous Ca2' release from the SR that
activates an inward transient current, possibly INaCa to de-
polarize the membrane. With isoproterenol in the extracel-
lular solution, they observed the appearance of both EADs
and DADs when a ventricular cell was paced at a rate of 1-2
Hz. Interventions that abolish DADs, such as block of Ca2+
release from the SR and reduction of inward NaCa (a candi-
date for I) also caused EADs to disappear in their experi-
ments. Their conclusion is in disagreement with our simu-
lations presented so far that used cesium or Bay K 8644 to
induce EADs. Our studies identify that reactivation of Ica is

Zeng and Rudy

the mechanism of EAD formation, different from the acti-
vation of INaCa that results in DADs.

To study whether INaQ, plays a role in the production of
EADs, isoproterenol, used experimentally by Priori and
Corr, is also used in our simulations. The ventricular cell is
paced at a drive cycle length (CL) of 600 ms, which is similar
to the rate used by Priori and Corr. In the presence of iso-
proterenol, EADs are induced when the cell is paced at a CL
of 600 ms. In the simulation, the cell is stimulated 36 times
and EADs begin from the 15th stimulated action potential.
After termination of pacing, DADs are observed. Each DAD
is accompanied by a calcium release from the JSR and an
intracellular calcium transient as shown in Fig. 9 in which the
last paced action potential and the first DAD are shown. Fig.
10 depicts the corresponding transmembrane L-type Ca2"
current as well as the Na'-Ca2" exchange current. A second

SR calcium release is not observed during the EAD (Fig. 9,
C and D). The slight increase in [Ca2+]i during the EAD (Fig.
9B) is caused by Ca2" entry through the L-type channels
when Ica is reactivated. As was demonstrated before, when
cesium and Bay K were used to induce EADs, 'Ca is the only
current that becomes more inward during the EAD depo-
larization phase. INa remains zero. INaca and all the other cur-
rents change toward a more outward direction in the same
period. When EADs are induced by isoproterenol (Fig. 9),
the [Ca2"]i transient has a peak value between 3 and 4 ,iM
during the paced action potential (three to four times its value
under normal conditions in the absence of isoproterenol). As
a result, INaCa (Fig. lOC) is mostly inward during the EAD
conditional phase with an average magnitude between 0.6
and 0.8 ,uA/p,F. During the EAD depolarizing phase, INaCa
remains inward but its magnitude decreases quickly and is
much smaller than that of 'Ca (arrow 1). In other words, al-
though during the entire repolarization phase of the action
potential INaCa is inward and contributes to the depolarization
of the membrane, it is clear that there is less contribution
during the EAD depolarizing phase than at other times. In
contrast, a very large inward transient of INaCa is induced by
the [Ca2+]i transient at the DAD depolarizing phase (arrow

2). This result is consistent with the generally accepted
mechanism responsible for the occurrence of DADs. Our
simulation results clearly suggest that EADs and DADs do
not share the same mechanism. Even in the presence of
isoproterenol, EADs require reactivation of 'Ca whereas
DADs require Ca2' release from the SR and activation of the
transient inward current.

IfINaCa is not the depolarizing charge carrier during EADs,
why do interventions that reduce the inward magnitude of
INaCa abolish EADs (as well as DADs) induced by isoprot-
erenol in the experiments of Priori and Corr? To address this
question, we simulate the experimental interventions used by
Priori and Corr (1990).

In the presence of isoproterenol, when the cell is paced at
a CL of 600 ms, both EADs and DADs develop (Fig. llA).
In the simulation of Fig. llB, isoproterenol is present and
extracellular Na+ concentration, [Na+]O, is reduced from 140
to 40 mM. This intervention reduces the inward driving force
on INaCa. After a 2-min exposure to the above environment

alone (no other intervention), both EADs and DADs develop. (B) [Na+]o is

concentration, [Na+]i, is decreased from 10 mM and reaches
a relatively stable value around 2.6 mM. Then the cell is
paced at a CL of 600 ms (Fig. llB). Both EADs and DADs
are abolished (cf. Fig. 11, A and B) although the maximum
Ca21 transient during the action potential is larger than that
under normal [Na']. and Ca21 is still spontaneously released
from the SR after pacing is terminated. The next intervention
that affects 'NaCa is reduction of the maximal conductance of
INaCa by 85% from the time marked by the arrow in Fig. llC.
This intervention is similar to the effect of benzamil, an ana-
logue of amiloride known to block Na'-Ca2' exchange. Both
EADs and DADs are abolished despite the large Ca>2 tran-
sient and the spontaneous release of Ca2 from the JSR that
still occurs. The last intervention that acts to reduce 'NaCa is
reduction of the [Ca21]i transient by blocking SR calcium
release. The maximal magnitude of the calcium release flux
is reduced by 90% starting at the time marked by the arrow
in Fig. liD. The [Ca+]i transient during the action potential
is reduced markedly. Both EADs and DADs disappear.

The above simulation results are consistent with the ex-
perimental observations of Priori and Corr. To investigate
why interventions that abolish DADs can also remove EADs
in this case, additional studies are required. When EADs are
present, conditions for an EAD formation are met during the
EAD conditional phase, meaning that the total transmem-
brane current can change from outward to inward during the
plateau of the action potential. As we have demonstrated that
'NaCa is not the depolarizing charge carrier during the EAD
depolarizing phase, inhibition of EADs by reduction of INaCa
should result from the inability to satisfy the conditions for
EAD formation during the EAD conditional phase.

With this hypothesis in mind, we try to explain why a
block of SR calcium release removes EADs induced by iso-
proterenol but not EADs induced by cesium. We compare
INaCa during normal and reduced SR calcium release for
the preparations with cesium or isoproterenol (Fig. 12). In the
presence of normal SR release, INaCa during the conditional
phase has a larger inward magnitude with the application
of isoproterenol (--0.6 pA/ptF) than with the application
of cesium (--0.1 ,tA/,F). So its contribution to I1O
during
the conditional phase for EAD development is more impor-
tant in the presence of isoproterenol than in the presence of
cesium. The previous simulations have demonstrated that
EADs can be induced if a 0.7 ,uA/,F constant inward current
is applied to the myocyte (Fig. 7C). Hence a 0.6 ,A/J,F
inward 'NaCa is an important current component ofIoal during
the EAD conditional phase. The relatively greater inward
'NaCa in the presence of isoproterenol is caused by the large
[Ca21]i transient during the action potential, which is three
to four times that under normal conditions, in the absence of
isoproterenol. Under these conditions, when SR calcium re-
lease is prevented, there is a large magnitude reduction of the
[Ca2+]i transient and 'NaCa becomes mostly outward rather
than inward during the plateau phase (Fig. 12A). This adds
a component of outward current during this phase and
changes the balance of currents in a way that is not favorable
for EAD formation. In contrast to isoproterenol, cesium

blocks only outward K+ current and does not affect signifi-
cantly the [Ca21]i transient (it is approximately the normal
value of 1 ,uM in Fig. 3, left panel). Therefore, when SR
calcium release is prevented in the presence of cesium, the
magnitude change of the calcium transient is small, a major
shift in the direction of INaCa is not observed, and ItotA0
is
minimally affected (Fig. 12B). In conclusion, in the presence
of isoproterenol, a relatively large inward magnitude of INaCa
during the plateau phase and a large reduction of INaCa when
SR calcium release is prevented is the underlying mechanism
for the removal of EADs by reducing SR calcium release.
Clearly, at a relatively high [Ca21]i, INaCa is more inward
during the EAD conditional phase and its contribution can be
as important as that of IK and Ica for meeting the conditions
for EAD formation. Note that although in the presence of a
large [Ca21]i transient, INaCa is important for EAD formation
because of its effect on the conditional phase, it is still Ica that
carries the depolarizing charge during the EAD.

Lowering [Na+]o reduces the inward driving force on the
Na'-Ca2' exchanger and benzamil decreases the conduc-

tance of the exchanger. Both interventions remove EADs
without significant reduction of the [Ca2+]i transient (Fig. 13,
B and C). At the plateau phase, the rate of repolarization is
very slow, which implies that the total ionic current has a
very small outward magnitude. In the presence of isoprot-
erenol, INaCa (without the interventions of Fig. 13, B and C)
has relatively large inward magnitude. INaCa under these con-
ditions is a very important current component for supporting
the plateau. Once this component is reduced, the plateau
duration is shortened. Prominent reduction of the magnitude
of this current is observed as a result of the two interventions
in Fig. 13, B and C. Hence, the duration of the plateau phase
of the action potential is significantly shortened. Because of
this, there is no significant time for Ic to reactivate and to
generate an EAD.

In conclusion, although in some cases 'NaCa may remain
inward during the EAD depolarizing phase, its magnitude
during this phase is much smaller than during the preceding
conditional phase. Therefore, INaCa does not contribute sig-
nificantly to the EAD depolarization process that is sup-
ported by Ic. during the EAD depolarization phase. 'NaCa may
play a secondary role in EAD formation. It may affect the
balance of transmembrane currents during the EAD condi-

tional phase. This in turn determines whether conditions that
favor EAD formation can be developed. At relatively high
[Ca2+]i, INac. has a relatively large inward magnitude and
prolongs the plateau. This allows for sufficient time for re-
activation of Ica and for the generation of EADs.

Rate dependence of EADs
To investigate the rate dependence of EADs, we simulate the
following protocols that were conducted experimentally by
Damiano and Rosen (1984). A single cell is exposed to a
normal Tyrode solution (4 mM K+) to which 5 mM Cs' is
added. The cell is paced at different CLs. As shown in Fig.
14, EADs are induced during slow pacing (CL > 1000 ms)
whereas at fast pacing rates, EADs are removed. DADs are
induced when the cell is paced very fast (CL ' 300 ms)
causing calcium accumulation and calcium overload condi-
tions (the mechanism of DADs due to calcium overload was

investigated in (Luo and Rudy, 1994b)). The behavior in Fig.
14 is consistent with the experimental observations of Dami-
ano and Rosen (1984).

To elucidate the mechanism underlying the rate depen-
dence of EADs, we compare the behavior of the L-type cal-
cium current, Ica,, and the delayed rectifier potassium current,
IK, at CLs of 600 and 1200 ms (Fig. 15). These currents are
important determinants of the membrane behavior during the
plateau phase and the early repolarization phase. As the ma-
jor contributors to the total transmembrane current, they in-
fluence significantly the balance of currents during the con-
ditional phase. At the slower rate (CL = 1200 ms), the
relative contribution of Ic. (inward, depolarizing) and of IK
(outward, repolarizing) is such that the total membrane cur-
rent becomes inward, and conditions for EAD development
are met. As can be seen in Fig. 15B, Ic. obtains a larger
magnitude at the faster rate. On the basis of previous simu-
lations, this behavior should favor the appearance of EADs
at this rate. As EADs actually disappear, other currents must
neutralize the depolarizing effects ofkCa Comparing IK at the
two CLs (Fig. 15C), we observe that this current increases
faster during the early plateau phase at the faster pacing rate

(Fig. 15C, CL = 600 ms, arrow 1). Note that the late large
maximum of IK at the slow pacing rate (Fig. 15C, arrow 2)
should not be considered in the comparison as it is caused by
the voltage dependence of IK during the EAD rather than
being a factor in the EAD formation. The increase of IK
counteracts the increase of 'Ca at the faster pacing rate. The
relative contribution of the two currents is such that the total
current during the conditional phase becomes outward, con-
ditions for EAD development are not met, and the EAD is
removed.

To explain the larger magnitude of Ica and IK at the faster
pacing rate, the underlying kinetic processes are further elu-
cidated in Figs. 16 and 17. At the faster rate, because less
is extruded from the cell by the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger
Ca
during the diastolic period, the intracellular Ca2+ concen-
tration (Fig. 16A) is relatively higher just before each pacing
stimulus (arrow) is applied (at CL = 600 ms, [Ca2+]I = 0.18
,uM; at CL = 1200 ms, [Ca2+]I = 0.14 ,uM). This causes a

FIGURE 17 The effect of pacing rate on IK- In the presence of cesium,
IK and its activation parameter are shown for two pacing rates. Immediately

channel (see Luo and Rudy, 1994a) and a smaller average Ica
during the first 2 ms of the action potential (Fig. 16D), re-
sulting in less Ca2' entry and a smaller Ca2+ transient during
the plateau phase of the action potential (Fig. 16A). This, in
turn, results in less Ca2+-dependent inactivation (Fig. 16D)
and a larger magnitude of Ica during this phase (Fig. 16B).
The increase of IK at the faster pacing rate is related to the
large time constant of its activation x-gate (between 130 and
450 ms) (Luo and Rudy, 1994a). After its activation during
the action potential, the x-gate requires a long time (-500
ms) to fully deactivate after repolarization. When the cell is
paced at a sufficiently fast rate, the pacing stimuli fall at a
time when IK is not completely deactivated (Fig. 17B). Be-
ginning from this partially activated state, the conductance
of IK attains a larger value during the action potentials at
faster pacing rates as compared with slow pacing rates that
permit complete deactivation of the x-gate between paced
beats. This results in a larger IK (Fig. 17A) during the plateau
phase (the conditional phase) at sufficiently fast pacing rates
that, being an outward current, counteracts the depolarizing
effect of the enlarged inward Ic. and prevents the formation
of an EAD.

[Ca2"]i, Ica, and its voltage- and calcium-dependent inactivation parameters,

transient is smaller. Hence there is less Ca2"-dependent inactivation (fca is
larger), which results in a larger magnitude of Ica.

DISCUSSION
The theoretical studies presented in this paper are designed
to investigate the mechanism of plateau EADs, to help re-
solve a controversy in the experimental literature regarding

962

their mechanism, and to help elucidate the mechanism of rate
dependence of EADs.

Following published experimental protocols (Marban
et al., 1986; January et al., 1988; January and Riddle, 1989;
Priori and Corr, 1990), we induced EADs in the ventricular
action potential model by simulating the effects of cesium,
Bay K 8644, and isoproterenol, respectively. For all of these
interventions, the mechanism of EAD depolarization in-
volves secondary reactivation of the L-type calcium channels
during the plateau. The reactivated Ica is essential for EAD
development and serves as a depolarizing charge carrier dur-
ing the EAD depolarization phase. In all cases, prolongation
of the action potential plateau is observed when an EAD
develops. This, in turn, provides more time at plateau po-
tential for the L-type Ca" channels to recover from inacti-
vation, a process that involves both the voltage-dependent (f)
and calcium-dependent (fca) inactivation gates (see Fig. 4).
Once sufficient recovery is achieved, Ic increases its inward
magnitude and depolarizes the membrane. This, in turn,
causes fast reactivation of the L-type channels through the
voltage-dependent characteristics of the activation d-gate
(arrow 3 in Fig. 4C), resulting in a fast further increase of
ICa. Thus, a positive feedback process that is characteristic of
fast depolarization is established by the kinetics of Ic., lead-
ing to EAD formation.
In addition to Ica, only the Na'-Ca2" exchange current,
'NaCa' is inward during the EAD depolarization phase. How-
ever, our simulations suggest that it does not play a primary
role in EAD formation. In contrast to the positive feedback
kinetics of kCa at this phase, INaCa actually decreases quickly
upon depolarization. In fact, the inward magnitude of INaCa
is smaller during EAD depolarization than during monotonic
repolarization in the absence of an EAD. Thus, the voltage-
dependence characteristics of INaCa and its behavior during
the EAD preclude the possibility that it can provide the
mechanism for the fast depolarization of the EAD. This con-
clusion is supported by the fact that fast depolarizing EADs
can be generated in the absence of INaCa during the EAD
depolarization phase, but not when reactivation of Ic. is pre-
vented (Fig. 5). It should be mentioned in this context that,
in the simulations, the magnitude of INaCa is much smaller
than the magnitude of Ica during the EAD depolarization
phase (Fig. 4). The exact ratio of these magnitudes depends
on the relative membrane densities of these ion transfer
mechanisms and could be species dependent. However, it is
the different kinetics (not the different magnitudes) ofI4 and
'NaCa that dictates their very different role during EAD de-
polarization. An important (but, at this stage, necessary) sim-
plification of our ventricular cell model is the assumption of
spatial uniformity inside the cell. In particular, spatial non-
uniformity of [Ca2+]i due to multilocal release sites in the SR,
spatial distribution of calcium buffers, restricted spaces, and
restricted diffusion is not considered (see Luo and Rudy
(1994a, b) for detailed discussion). As a result, the global
[Ca2"]I, not the local calcium activity at the exchange site,
regulates the Na'-Ca2" exchange function in the model. Al-
though this approximation does not consider details of the

regulation ofNa'-Ca2" exchange on a subcellular scale, 'NaCa
as formulated in the model simulates correctly its measured
voltage dependence and ionic concentration dependence
(Luo and Rudy, 1994a). As it is the voltage dependence of
INaCa that causes it to change from inward to outward during
the EAD depolarization phase, the conclusion regarding its
inability to be the primary depolarizing current for EAD for-
mation should not be affected by the global, cellular level
approach. Similar comments apply to the Ca2"-dependent
inactivation process of the L-type calcium channels. Inclu-
sion of spatial nonuniformities requires knowledge of the
distribution of calcium buffers, of release and uptake sites in
the SR, and of the geometry and locations of intracellular
organelles. Such detailed geometrical information is not yet
available at the present time.
EADs that are induced by cesium are not removed by
interventions that reduce the [Ca2+]i transient and the mag-
nitude of INaCa (our simulations and experiments of Marban
et al. (1986)). In contrast, EADs that are induced by iso-
proterenol are abolished by interventions that inhibit SR cal-
cium release and reduce 'NaCa (our simulations and experi-
ments of Priori and Corr (1990)). The last observation led
Priori and Corr to suggest that INaCa is the primary current
responsible for EAD depolarization and that EADs and
DADs share the same mechanism (Ca" release from the SR
that triggers INaCa). Our simulations demonstrate that a sec-
ond SR calcium release does not occur during an EAD. The
removal of EADs when 'NaCa is reduced in the isoproterenol
preparation can be explained by the effect of INaCa on the
conditional phase that precedes the EAD. The simulated
Priori and Corr protocols generate a large [Ca2+]i transient
(three to four times the normal magnitude of 1.0 ,uM that is
also the magnitude in the cesium protocols). As a result, 'NaCa
is also large and becomes an important inward component of
the total membrane current during the conditional phase. As
demonstrated in Results, an EAD can develop if the total
transmembrane current becomes inward during the condi-
tional phase. For the isoproterenol protocols, interventions
that reduce 'NaCa can sufficiently change the balance of cur-
rents so that it does not become inward and conditions for
EAD formation do not develop. In the case of cesium, INaCa
during the conditional phase is small (- 0.1 pA/,uF) and has
only a minor effect on the balance of currents. Consequently,
interventions that reduce INaCa do not influence the conditions
for EAD development and do not remove the EAD. INaca
affects EAD generation indirectly, through its effect on the
conditional phase that precedes the EAD. The primary
mechanism is reactivation of Ic, that depolarizes the mem-
brane to generate the EAD.
Our conclusion that kCa is the major depolarizing charge
carrier during the EAD depolarization phase is based on pro-
tocols that involve cesium, Bay K 8644, and isoproterenol.
A similar mechanism was also suggested for EADs generated
under conditions of calcium overload (Luo and Rudy, 1994b)
and by the application of quinidine (Nattel and Quantz, 1988)
or cocaine (Kimura et al., 1992). All of these interventions
bear a high degree of clinical relevance. However, extreme

modification of the inward fast Na+ current, INa' may produce
an additional component of inward current during the plateau
and induce EADs. Such an intervention was performed by
Boutjdir and El-Sherif (1991) and Hiraoka et al. (1992) to
study EADs. ATXII (Boutjdir and El-Sherif, 1991) and
veratridine (Hiraoka et al., 1992) were used to cause ex-
treme prolongation of INa inactivation. In fact, the time
constant of INa inactivation is increased
-15-fold by
ATXII and -200-fold by veratridine and becomes similar
to or longer than that of 'Ca inactivation.

EADs are associated with bradycardia and slow pacing
(Cranefield and Aronson, 1988). They may contribute to the
polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias in patients with the
long QT syndrome that manifest as Torsade de Pointes in
the electrocardiogram (Hiraoka et al., 1992; Rosen, 1990).
In the simulations, EADs were present at CL > 1000 ms. This
behavior is consistent with the experimental observations of
Damiano and Rosen (1984) and supports the notion that
EADs are bradycardia related. The appearance or disappear-
ance of EADs is determined by the relative contributions of
Ica and IKto the total membrane current during the conditional
phase. At slow rates, the magnitude ratio of Ich (inward) and IK
(outward) is sufficient to result in an inward total transmembrane
current so that conditions for EAD development are met. At fast
rates (CL < 1000 ms), the increase in IK more than offsets the
increase in Ic, resulting in a net outward (repolarizing) current
during the conditional phase and in EAD removal.

Several limitations of the model should be mentioned in
the context of the EAD study presented here. The model is
based mostly on the guinea pig ventricular cell and does not
include the transient outward current, Ito which is not present
in this cell. In ventricular cells of other species (e.g., dog,
rabbit, and rat) Ito is a very important current for repolar-
ization and should be included in models of the ventricular
action potential and in studies of EADs in these species.
Consequently, some of our conclusions may apply only to the
guinea pig type of cells and cannot be extrapolated to other
types of cells that display a prominent I,. or other processes
that are not present in the guinea pig myocyte. Another limi-
tation of the model is that the delayed rectifier, IK' is not
separated into its two components, IK4 and IK,. Therefore,
only the role of IK in its global presentation (as a superpo-
sition of IK, and IKS) could be investigated. It will be inter-
esting, in future studies, to examine the separate role and
relative importance of IK4 and IK, in repolarization and EAD
formation. Work to formulate IK, and IKs and to incorporate
them in the action potential model is currently conducted in
our laboratory.
