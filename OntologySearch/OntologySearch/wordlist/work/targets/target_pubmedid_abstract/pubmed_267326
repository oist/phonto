Oscillation and chaos in physiological control systems.

Mackey MC, Glass L.

First-order nonlinear differential-delay equations describing physiological
control systems are studied. The equations display a broad diversity of dynamical
behavior including limit cycle oscillations, with a variety of wave forms, and
apparently aperiodic or "chaotic" solutions. These results are discussed in
relation to dynamical respiratory and hematopoietic diseases.
