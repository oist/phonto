A mathematical insulin-secretion model was constructed by analyzing the
glucose-induced insulin secretion using a control theory. To validate the model, 
experimental data obtained in the isolated rat pancreatic islet perifusion system
were compared with the simulation results. The simulation study of the model was 
found to fit quite well to insulin responses under various experimental
conditions. A glucose-induced insulin secretion from pancreatic islets' beta cell
was found to be expressed as a function of proportional plus derivative response 
to glucose input with the first order time lag. And the negative rate of change
in glucose concentration was found to suppress insulin secretion to the extent of
the negative stimuli, regardless of glucose concentration. This model would be
useful as a research tool for analysis of physiological significance of insulin
secretory dynamics and clinical investigation of insulin secretion.
