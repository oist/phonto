Minimal model for membrane oscillations in the pancreatic beta-cell.

Chay TR, Keizer J.

Following the experimental findings of Atwater et al. (In Biochemistry Biophysics
of the Pancreatic-beta-Cell, George Thieme Verlag, New York, 100-107), we have
formulated a mathematical model for ionic and electrical events that take place
in pancreatic-beta-cells. Our formulation incorporates a Hodgkin-Huxley type
gating mechanism for Ca2+ and K+ channels, in addition to Ca2+ gated K+-channels.
Consistent with the experimental observations, our model generates spikes and
bursts in beta-cell membrane potentials and gives the correct responses to
additions of glucose, quinine, and tetraethylammonium ions. The response of the
oscillations to ouabain and changing concentrations of external K+ can be
incorporated into the present model, although a more complete treatment would
require inclusion of the Na+/K+ pump.
