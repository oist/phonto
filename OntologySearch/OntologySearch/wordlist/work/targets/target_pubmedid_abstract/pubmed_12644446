We have developed a detailed mathematical model of ionic flux in beta-cells that 
includes the most essential channels and pumps in the plasma membrane. This model
is coupled to equations describing Ca2+, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), ATP,
and Na+ homeostasis, including the uptake and release of Ca2+ by the endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER). In our model, metabolically derived ATP activates inward Ca2+
flux by regulation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels and depolarization of the plasma 
membrane. Results from the simulations support the hypothesis that intracellular 
Na+ and Ca2+ in the ER can be the main variables driving both fast (2-7 osc/min) 
and slow intracellular Ca2+ concentration oscillations (0.3-0.9 osc/min) and that
the effect of IP3 on Ca2+ leak from the ER contributes to the pattern of slow
calcium oscillations. Simulations also show that filling the ER Ca2+ stores leads
to faster electrical bursting and Ca2+ oscillations. Specific Ca2+ oscillations
in isolated beta-cell lines can also be simulated.
