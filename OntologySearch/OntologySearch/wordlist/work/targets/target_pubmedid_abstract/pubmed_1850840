We investigate the hypothesis that two classes of Ca2+ currents, one quickly
inactivated by Ca2+ and one slowly inactivated by voltage, contribute to bursting
electrical activity in pancreatic islets. A mathematical model of these currents 
is fit to the experimental whole-cell current-voltage and inactivation profiles, 
thereby fixing the Ca2+ conductance and all activation and inactivation
parameters. Incorporating these currents into a model that includes delayed
rectifier K+ channels and ATP-sensitive K+ channels, we show that only abnormal
bursting is obtained. Modification of activation parameters to increase Ca2+
channel open times, as suggested by experiment, yields a more robust bursting
similar to that observed in intact islets. This reinforces the suggestion that in
addition to ATP-sensitive K+ channels, Ca2+ channels may serve as glucose sensors
in the beta cell.
