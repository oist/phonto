The mechanisms underlying many important properties of the human atrial action
potential (AP) are poorly understood. Using specific formulations of the K+, Na+,
and Ca2+ currents based on data recorded from human atrial myocytes, along with
representations of pump, exchange, and background currents, we developed a
mathematical model of the AP. The model AP resembles APs recorded from human
atrial samples and responds to rate changes, L-type Ca2+ current blockade,
Na+/Ca2+ exchanger inhibition, and variations in transient outward current
amplitude in a fashion similar to experimental recordings. Rate-dependent
adaptation of AP duration, an important determinant of susceptibility to atrial
fibrillation, was attributable to incomplete L-type Ca2+ current recovery from
inactivation and incomplete delayed rectifier current deactivation at rapid
rates. Experimental observations of variable AP morphology could be accounted for
by changes in transient outward current density, as suggested experimentally. We 
conclude that this mathematical model of the human atrial AP reproduces a variety
of observed AP behaviors and provides insights into the mechanisms of clinically 
important AP properties.
