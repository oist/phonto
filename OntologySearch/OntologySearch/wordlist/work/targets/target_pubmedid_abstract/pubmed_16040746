Dynamical mechanisms of the biological pacemaker (BP) generation in human
ventricular myocytes were investigated by bifurcation analyses of a mathematical 
model. Equilibrium points (EPs), periodic orbits, stability of EPs, and
bifurcation points were determined as functions of bifurcation parameters, such
as the maximum conductance of inward-rectifier K+ current (I(K1)), for
constructing bifurcation diagrams. Stable limit cycles (BP activity) abruptly
appeared around an unstable EP via a saddle-node bifurcation when I(K1) was
suppressed by 84.6%. After the bifurcation at which a stable EP disappears, the
I(K1)-reduced system has an unstable EP only, which is essentially important for 
stable pacemaking. To elucidate how individual sarcolemmal currents contribute to
EP instability and BP generation, we further explored the bifurcation structures 
of the system during changes in L-type Ca2+ channel current (I(Ca,L)),
delayed-rectifier K+ currents (I(K)), or Na(+)/Ca2+ exchanger current (I(NaCa)). 
Our results suggest that 1), I(Ca,L) is, but I(K) or I(NaCa) is not, responsible 
for EP instability as a requisite to stable BP generation; 2), I(K) is
indispensable for robust pacemaking with large amplitude, high upstroke velocity,
and stable frequency; and 3), I(NaCa) is the dominant pacemaker current but is
not necessarily required for the generation of spontaneous oscillations.
