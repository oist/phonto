On the effect of the intracellular calcium-sensitive K+ channel in the bursting
pancreatic beta-cell.

Chay TR.

Based on the observation that the calcium-activated K+ channel in the pancreatic 
islet cells can also be activated by the membrane potential, we have formulated a
mathematical model for the electrical activity in the pancreatic beta-cell. Our
model contains two types of ionic channels, which are active above the
subthreshold glucose concentration in the limit-cycle region: a Ca2+-activated,
voltage-gated K+ channel and voltage-gated Ca2+ channel. Numerical simulation of 
the model generates bursts of electrical activity in response to a variation of
kCa, the rate constant for sequestration of intracellular calcium ions. The
period and duration of the bursts in response to kCa are in good agreement with
experiment. The model predicts that a combined spike and burst pattern can be
created using only single species of inward and outward currents, the
inactivation kinetics (i.e., h) in the inward current is not a necessary
condition for the generation of the pattern, and a given pattern or intensity of 
electrical activity may produce different levels of intracellular Ca2+ depending 
on the set of certain electrical parameters.
