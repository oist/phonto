It is becoming increasingly clear that bistability (or, more generally,
multistability) is an important recurring theme in cell signaling. Bistability
may be of particular relevance to biological systems that switch between discrete
states, generate oscillatory responses, or "remember" transitory stimuli.
Standard mathematical methods allow the detection of bistability in some very
simple feedback systems (systems with one or two proteins or genes that either
activate each other or inhibit each other), but realistic depictions of signal
transduction networks are invariably much more complex. Here, we show that for a 
class of feedback systems of arbitrary order the stability properties of the
system can be deduced mathematically from how the system behaves when feedback is
blocked. Provided that this open-loop, feedback-blocked system is monotone and
possesses a sigmoidal characteristic, the system is guaranteed to be bistable for
some range of feedback strengths. We present a simple graphical method for
deducing the stability behavior and bifurcation diagrams for such systems and
illustrate the method with two examples taken from recent experimental studies of
bistable systems: a two-variable Cdc2/Wee1 system and a more complicated
five-variable mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade.
