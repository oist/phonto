Mathematical description of a bursting pacemaker neuron by a modification of the 
Hodgkin-Huxley equations.

Plant RE, Kim M.

Modifications based on experimental results reported in the literature are made
to the Hodgkin-Huxley equations to describe the electrophysiological behavior of 
the Aplysia abdominal ganglion R15 cell. The system is then further modified to
describe the effects with the application of the drug tetrodotoxin (TTX) to the
cells' bathing medium. Methods of the qualitative theory of differential
equations are used to determine the conditions necessary for such a system of
equations to have an oscillatory solution. A model satisfying these conditions is
shown to preduct many experimental observations of R15 cell behavior. Numerical
solutions are obtained for differential equations satisfying the conditions of
the model. These solutions are shown to have a form similar to that of the
bursting which is characteristic of this cell, and to preduct many results of
experiments conducted on this cell. The physiological implications of the model
are discussed.
