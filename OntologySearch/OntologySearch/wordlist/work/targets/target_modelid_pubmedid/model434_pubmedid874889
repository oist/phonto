Reconstruction of the action potential of ventricular myocardial fibres.

Beeler GW, Reuter H.

1. A mathematical model of membrane action potentials of mammalian ventricular
myocardial fibres is described. The reconstruction model is based as closely as
possible on ionic currents which have been measured by the voltage-clamp
method.2. Four individual components of ionic current were formulated
mathematically in terms of Hodgkin-Huxley type equations. The model incorporates 
two voltage- and time-dependent inward currents, the excitatory inward sodium
current, i(Na), and a secondary or slow inward current, i(s), primarily carried
by calcium ions. A time-independent outward potassium current, i(K1), exhibiting 
inward-going rectification, and a voltage- and time-dependent outward current,
i(x1), primarily carried by potassium ions, are further elements of the model.3. 
The i(Na) is primarily responsible for the rapid upstroke of the action
potential, while the other current components determine the configuration of the 
plateau of the action potential and the re-polarization phase. The relative
importance of inactivation of i(s) and of activation of i(x1) for termination of 
the plateau is evaluated by the model.4. Experimental phenomena like slow
recovery of the sodium system from inactivation, frequency dependence of the
action potential duration, all-or-nothing re-polarization, membrane oscillations 
are adequately described by the model.5. Possible inadequacies and shortcomings
of the model are discussed.
