We propose an analog-digital hybrid circuit model of one-dimensional cardiac
tissue with hardware implementation that allows us to perform real-time
simulations of spatially conducting cardiac action potentials. Each active nodal 
compartment of the tissue model is designed using analog circuits and a dsPIC
microcontroller, by which the time-dependent and time-independent nonlinear
current-voltage relationships of six types of ion channel currents employed in
the Luo-Rudy phase I (LR-I) model for a single mammalian cardiac ventricular cell
can be reproduced quantitatively. Here, we perform real-time simulations of
reentrant excitation conduction in a ring-shaped tissue model that includes
eighty nodal compartments. In particular, we show that the hybrid tissue model
can exhibit real-time dynamics for initiation of reentries induced by
uni-directional block, as well as those for phase resetting that leads to
annihilation of the reentry in response to impulsive current stimulations at
appropriate nodes and timings. The dynamics of the hybrid model are comparable to
those of a spatially distributed tissue model with LR-I compartments. Thus, it is
conceivable that the hybrid model might be a useful tool for large scale
simulations of cardiac tissue dynamics, as an alternative to numerical
simulations, leading toward further understanding of the reentrant mechanisms.
