Basic cellular and network mechanisms underlying gamma frequency oscillations
(30-80 Hz) have been well characterized in the hippocampus and associated
structures. In these regions, gamma rhythms are seen as an emergent property of
networks of principal cells and fast-spiking interneurons. In contrast, in the
neocortex a number of elegant studies have shown that specific types of principal
neuron exist that are capable of generating powerful gamma frequency outputs on
the basis of their intrinsic conductances alone. These fast rhythmic bursting
(FRB) neurons (sometimes referred to as "chattering" cells) are activated by
sensory stimuli and generate multiple action potentials per gamma period. Here,
we demonstrate that FRB neurons may function by providing a large-scale input to 
an axon plexus consisting of gap-junctionally connected axons from both FRB
neurons and their anatomically similar counterparts regular spiking neurons. The 
resulting network gamma oscillation shares all of the properties of gamma
oscillations generated in the hippocampus but with the additional critical
dependence on multiple spiking in FRB cells.
