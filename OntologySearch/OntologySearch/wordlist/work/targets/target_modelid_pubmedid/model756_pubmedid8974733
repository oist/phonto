Synchronization properties of fully connected networks of identical oscillatory
neurons are studied, assuming purely excitatory interactions. We analyze their
dependence on the time course of the synaptic interaction and on the response of 
the neurons to small depolarizations. Two types of responses are distinguished.
In the first type, neurons always respond to small depolarization by advancing
the next spike. In the second type, an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP)
received after the refractory period delays the firing of the next spike, while
an EPSP received at a later time advances the firing. For these two types of
responses we derive general conditions under which excitation destabilizes
in-phase synchrony. We show that excitation is generally desynchronizing for
neurons with a response of type I but can be synchronizing for responses of type 
II when the synaptic interactions are fast. These results are illustrated on
three models of neurons: the Lapicque integrate-and-fire model, the model of
Connor et al., and the Hodgkin-Huxley model. The latter exhibits a type II
response, at variance with the first two models, that have type I responses. We
then examine the consequences of these results for large networks, focusing on
the states of partial coherence that emerge. Finally, we study the Lapicque model
and the model of Connor et al. at large coupling and show that excitation can be 
desynchronizing even beyond the weak coupling regime.
