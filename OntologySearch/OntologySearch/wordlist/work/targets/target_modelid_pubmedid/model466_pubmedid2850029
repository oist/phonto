Pancreatic beta-cells in an intact Islet of Langerhans exhibit bursting
electrical behavior. The Chay-Keizer model describes this using a
calcium-activated potassium (K-Ca) channel, but cannot account for the irregular 
spiking of isolated beta-cells. Atwater I., L. Rosario, and E. Rojas, Cell
Calcium. 4:451-461, proposed that the K-Ca channels, which are rarely open, are
shared by several cells. This suggests that the chaotic behavior of isolated
cells is stochastic. We have revised the Chay-Keizer model to incorporate voltage
clamp data of Rorsman and Trube and extended it to include stochastic K-Ca
channels. This model can describe the behavior of single cells, as well as that
of clusters of cells tightly coupled by gap junctions. As the size of the
clusters is increased, the electrical activity shows a transition from chaotic
spiking to regular bursting. Although the model of coupling is over-simplified,
the simulations lend support to the hypothesis that bursting is the result of
channel sharing.
