A new principle of sensorimotor control of legged locomotion in an unpredictable 
environment is proposed on the basis of neurophysiological knowledge and a theory
of nonlinear dynamics. Stable and flexible locomotion is realized as a global
limit cycle generated by a global entrainment between the rhythmic activities of 
a nervous system composed of coupled neural oscillators and the rhythmic
movements of a musculo-skeletal system including interaction with its
environment. Coordinated movements are generated not by slaving to an explicit
representation of the precise trajectories of the movement of each part but by
dynamic interactions among the nervous system, the musculo-skeletal system and
the environment. The performance of a bipedal model based on the above principle 
was investigated by computer simulation. Walking movements stable to mechanical
perturbations and to environmental changes were obtained. Moreover, the model
generated not only the walking movement but also the running movement by changing
a single parameter nonspecific to the movement. The transitions between the gait 
patterns occurred with hysteresis.
