In this paper, we formulate a model for human ventricular cells that is efficient
enough for whole organ arrhythmia simulations yet detailed enough to capture the 
effects of cell level processes such as current blocks and channelopathies. The
model is obtained from our detailed human ventricular cell model by using
mathematical techniques to reduce the number of variables from 19 to nine. We
carefully compare our full and reduced model at the single cell, cable and 2D
tissue level and show that the reduced model has a very similar behaviour.
Importantly, the new model correctly produces the effects of current blocks and
channelopathies on AP and spiral wave behaviour, processes at the core of current
day arrhythmia research. The new model is well over four times more efficient
than the full model. We conclude that the new model can be used for efficient
simulations of the effects of current changes on arrhythmias in the human heart.
