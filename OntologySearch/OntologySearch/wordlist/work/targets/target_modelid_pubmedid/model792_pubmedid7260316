Voltage oscillations in the barnacle giant muscle fiber.

Morris C, Lecar H.

Barnacle muscle fibers subjected to constant current stimulation produce a
variety of types of oscillatory behavior when the internal medium contains the
Ca++ chelator EGTA. Oscillations are abolished if Ca++ is removed from the
external medium, or if the K+ conductance is blocked. Available voltage-clamp
data indicate that the cell's active conductance systems are exceptionally
simple. Given the complexity of barnacle fiber voltage behavior, this seems
paradoxical. This paper presents an analysis of the possible modes of behavior
available to a system of two noninactivating conductance mechanisms, and
indicates a good correspondence to the types of behavior exhibited by barnacle
fiber. The differential equations of a simple equivalent circuit for the fiber
are dealt with by means of some of the mathematical techniques of nonlinear
mechanics. General features of the system are (a) a propensity to produce damped 
or sustained oscillations over a rather broad parameter range, and (b)
considerable latitude in the shape of the oscillatory potentials. It is concluded
that for cells subject to changeable parameters (either from cell to cell or with
time during cellular activity), a system dominated by two noninactivating
conductances can exhibit varied oscillatory and bistable behavior.
