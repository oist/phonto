The pacemaker activity of the S-A node cell was explained by reconstructing the
pacemaker potential using a Hodgkin-Huxley type mathematical model which was
based on the reported voltage clamp data. In this model four dynamic currents,
the sodium current iNa, the slow inward current, is, the potassium current, iK,
and the hyperpolarization-activated current, ih, in addition to a time-dependent 
leak current, i1 were included. The model simulated the spontaneous action
potential the current voltage relationship, and the voltage clamp experiment in
normal Tyrode solution of the rabbit S-A node. Furthermore, the changes of
activity induced by the potassium current blocker Ba2+, by applying constant
current, acetylcholine, and epinephrine were also reconstructed. It was strongly 
suggested that the pacemaker depolarization in the S-A node cell is mainly due to
a gradual increase of iS during diastole, and that the contribution of iK is much
less compared to the potassium current iK2 in the Purkinje fiber pacemaker
depolarization. The rising phase of the action potential was due to iS and the
plateau phase is determined by both the inactivation of iS and activation of iK.
