We describe a transition from bursting to rapid spiking in a reduced mathematical
model of a cerebellar Purkinje cell. We perform a slow-fast analysis of the
system and find that-after a saddle node bifurcation of limit cycles-the full
model dynamics temporarily follow a repelling branch of limit cycles. We propose 
that the system exhibits a dynamical phenomenon new to realistic, biophysical
applications: torus canards.
