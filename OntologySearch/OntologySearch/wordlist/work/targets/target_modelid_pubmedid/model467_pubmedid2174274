The "shell" model for Ca2(+)-inactivation of Ca2+ channels is based on the
accumulation of Ca2+ in a macroscopic shell beneath the plasma membrane. The
shell is filled by Ca2+ entering through open channels, with the elevated Ca2+
concentration inactivating both open and closed channels at a rate determined by 
how fast the shell is filled. In cells with low channel density, the high
concentration Ca2+ "shell" degenerates into a collection of nonoverlapping
"domains" localized near open channels. These domains form rapidly when channels 
open and disappear rapidly when channels close. We use this idea to develop a
"domain" model for Ca2(+)-inactivation of Ca2+ channels. In this model the
kinetics of formation of an inactivated state resulting from Ca2+ binding to open
channels determines the inactivation rate, a mechanism identical with that which 
explains single-channel recordings on rabbit-mesenteric artery Ca2+ channels
(Huang Y., J. M. Quayle, J. F. Worley, N. B. Standen, and M. T. Nelson. 1989.
Biophys. J. 56:1023-1028). We show that the model correctly predicts five
important features of the whole-cell Ca2(+)-inactivation for mouse pancreatic
beta-cells (Plants, T. D. 1988. J. Physiol. 404:731-747) and that
Ca2(+)-inactivation has only minor effects on the bursting electrical activity of
these cells.
