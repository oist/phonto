The bandpass filtering properties of a rod network were studied via computer
simulations. Sinusoidal current stimuli were applied to a single rod model to
characterize its temporal filtering properties. The simulated frequency response 
revealed that a single rod behaves as a bandpass filter whose characteristics are
affected by the stimulus strength and frequency. We analyzed the contribution of 
individual ionic currents to bandpass filtering and found that the filtering of
small signals is largely regulated by the calcium-dependent currents I(K(Ca)) and
I(Cl(Ca)), whereas the filtering of large signals is regulated by the
hyperpolarization-activated current, I(h). Furthermore, rod network modeling by
electrically interconnecting the single rod models revealed that the acceleration
of signals that spread laterally through the rod network is attributed to
I(K(Ca)) and not I(h).
