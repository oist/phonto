Sustained oscillations generated by mutually inhibiting neurons with adaptation.

Matsuoka K.

Autonomic oscillatory activities exist in almost every living thing and most of
them are produced by rhythmic activities of the corresponding neural systems
(locomotion, respiration, heart beat, etc.). This paper mathematically discusses 
sustained oscillations generated by mutual inhibition of the neurons which are
represented by a continuous-variable model with a kind of fatigue or adaptation
effect. If the neural network has no stable stationary state for constant input
stimuli, it will generate and sustain some oscillation for any initial state and 
for any disturbance. Some sufficient conditions for that are given to three types
of neural networks: lateral inhibition networks of linearly arrayed neurons,
symmetric inhibition networks and cyclic inhibition networks. The result suggests
that the adaptation of the neurons plays a very important role for the appearance
of the oscillations. Some computer simulations of rhythmic activities are also
presented for cyclic inhibition networks consisting of a few neurons.
