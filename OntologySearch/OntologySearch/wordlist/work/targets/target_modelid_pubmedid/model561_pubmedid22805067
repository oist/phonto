A key pathology in the development of Parkinson's disease is the occurrence of
persistent beta oscillations, which are correlated with difficulty in movement
initiation. We investigated the network model composed of the subthalamic nucleus
(STN) and globus pallidus (GP) developed by A. Nevado Holgado et al. [(2010)
Journal of Neuroscience, 30, 12340-12352], who identified the conditions under
which this circuit could generate beta oscillations. Our work extended their
analysis by deriving improved analytic stability conditions for realistic values 
of the synaptic transmission delay between STN and GP neurons. The improved
conditions were significantly closer to the results of simulations for the range 
of synaptic transmission delays measured experimentally. Furthermore, our
analysis explained how changes in cortical and striatal input to the STN-GP
network influenced oscillations generated by the circuit. As we have identified
when a system of mutually connected populations of excitatory and inhibitory
neurons can generate oscillations, our results may also find applications in the 
study of neural oscillations produced by assemblies of excitatory and inhibitory 
neurons in other brain regions.
