Impulses and Physiological States in Theoretical Models of Nerve Membrane.

Fitzhugh R.

Van der Pol's equation for a relaxation oscillator is generalized by the addition
of terms to produce a pair of non-linear differential equations with either a
stable singular point or a limit cycle. The resulting "BVP model" has two
variables of state, representing excitability and refractoriness, and
qualitatively resembles Bonhoeffer's theoretical model for the iron wire model of
nerve. This BVP model serves as a simple representative of a class of
excitable-oscillatory systems including the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model of the
squid giant axon. The BVP phase plane can be divided into regions corresponding
to the physiological states of nerve fiber (resting, active, refractory,
enhanced, depressed, etc.) to form a "physiological state diagram," with the help
of which many physiological phenomena can be summarized. A properly chosen
projection from the 4-dimensional HH phase space onto a plane produces a similar 
diagram which shows the underlying relationship between the two models. Impulse
trains occur in the BVP and HH models for a range of constant applied currents
which make the singular point representing the resting state unstable.
