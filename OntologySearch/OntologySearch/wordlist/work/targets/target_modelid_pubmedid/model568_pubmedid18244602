A model is presented that reproduces spiking and bursting behavior of known types
of cortical neurons. The model combines the biologically plausibility of
Hodgkin-Huxley-type dynamics and the computational efficiency of
integrate-and-fire neurons. Using this model, one can simulate tens of thousands 
of spiking cortical neurons in real time (1 ms resolution) using a desktop PC.
