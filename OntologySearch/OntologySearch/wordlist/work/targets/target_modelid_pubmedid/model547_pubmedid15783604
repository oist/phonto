We study a continuous and reversible transition between periodic tonic spiking
and bursting activities in a neuron model. It is described as the blue-sky
catastrophe, which is a homoclinic bifurcation of a saddle-node periodic orbit of
codimension one. This transition constitutes a biophysically plausible mechanism 
for the regulation of burst duration that increases with no bound like 1/square
root alpha-alpha0 as the transition value alpha0 is approached.
