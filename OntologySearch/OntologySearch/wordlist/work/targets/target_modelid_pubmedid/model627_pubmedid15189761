Many drugs inhibit human ether-a-go-go related gene (HERG) current and prolong
cardiac action potential duration. We examined the kinetic properties of
quinidine block of HERG channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes in comparison with 
those of the block by a class III antiarrhythmic dofetilide. Both of the drugs
inhibited HERG currents in a use-dependent and frequency-independent manner.
However, the underlying mechanisms were different. Under the steady state,
quinidine block was voltage- and time-dependent. At positive membrane potentials,
the onset of block was very fast. Thus, quinidine caused frequency-independent
block mainly through this fast blocking kinetic. In contrast, dofetilide blocked 
HERG currents in a voltage- and time-independent manner under the steady state
because of very slow unblocking at negative potentials, which also caused
frequency-independent block. Therefore, quinidine and dofetilide might cause the 
reverse frequency-dependent prolongation of action potential duration through
distinct mechanisms with regard to blocking and unblocking kinetics.
