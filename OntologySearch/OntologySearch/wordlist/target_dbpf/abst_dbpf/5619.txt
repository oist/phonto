1. Inferotemporal, hippocampal, and parahippocampal units were recorded while monkeys were alert (as judged by eye movements) but resting, in both light and dark. 2. Spontaneous saccadic eye movements produced significant changes in unit activity for 108 of 308 cells. This activity is shown to be extraretinal either because it occurred in complete darkness or because of its timing relative to the eye movement. 3. The total saccadic modulation in the ventral temporal lobe is estimated to be over ten million action potentials.
