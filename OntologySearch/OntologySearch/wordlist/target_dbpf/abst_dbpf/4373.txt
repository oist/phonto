In the present study, both potentiation and depression of the synaptic response were induced in hippocampal CA1 neurons by systematically varying the frequency of low frequency afferent stimulation (LFS) between 0.5-25 Hz and the pulse number between 40-1000. The input-response relationship for CA1 synapses showed that LFS at a higher frequency or with a smaller pulse number increased the magnitude of potentiation of the synaptic response by increasing the contribution of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) to induction of potentiation. One possible mechanism for this bidirectional plasticity was that specific patterns of LFS differentially activate a uniform receptor population in producing depression or potentiation of synaptic responses. However, a pharmacological study indicated that, despite their opposite effects, both the synaptic depression induced by LFS at 1 Hz and the synaptic potentiation induced by LFS at 10 Hz were triggered by co-activation of NMDARs and mGluRs at CA1 synapses.
