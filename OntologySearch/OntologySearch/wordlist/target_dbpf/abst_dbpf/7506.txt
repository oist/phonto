Synaptic Transmission
We have produced a mouse strain in which the deletion of the NMDAR1 gene is restricted to the CA1 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus by using a new and general method that allows CA1-restricted gene knockout. The mutant mice grow into adulthood without obvious abnormalities. Adult mice lack NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents and long-term potentiation in the CA1 synapses and exhibit impaired spatial memory but unimpaired nonspatial learning. Our results strongly suggest that activity-dependent modifications of CA1 synapses, mediated by NMDA receptors, play an essential role in the acquisition of spatial memories.
