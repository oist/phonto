This study, together with a parallel study in rats (Markowska et al. 1988), attempted to relate the effects of hippocampal-system damage on similar tasks in both rats and monkeys. Not only were monkeys given a task (Experiment 1) which was of the sort usually used with rats, but in the companion study rats were given tasks (Experiment 2) like those usually used with monkeys. Experiment 1 examined the performance of rhesus monkeys with hippocampal-system damage on a spatial working memory task. Monkeys were trained preoperatively on delayed nonmatching-to-sample in a T-maze, placed into groups matched for their preoperative learning scores, and then received one of three treatments: 1) transection of the fornix; 2) ablation of the cingulate cortex; or 3) a sham operation. Monkeys with fornix transection were severely and significantly impaired, but monkeys with cingulate cortical ablations were not significantly impaired, relative to the controls. The results demonstrate that monkeys with fornix transection are severely impaired on a spatial working memory task requiring locomotion and, taken together with earlier work, suggest that the effect of fornix transection in both rodents and nonhuman primates is at least qualitatively similar (see Markowska et al. 1988). Experiment 2 assessed the role of the fornix and cingulate cortex in three conditional tasks in which the monkeys were provided with various spatial cues to indicate which one of two objects was rewarded. Both experimental groups were unimpaired, relative to the control group, on all three tasks, indicating that fornix transection does not produce a general impairment in place learning.
