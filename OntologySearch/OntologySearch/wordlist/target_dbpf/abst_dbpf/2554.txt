The contexts in cognition and behavioral situation are required for the establishment of the synthetic logic. In this paper, we show that the hippocampus represents the contextual information as spatio-temporal pattern of neural activities generated by synchronization. The information structure in the brain to enable the operation of synthetic logic is elucidated based on the concept of Gestalt cycle and it relevance to hippocampal function. It is concluded that the circulation loop in the brain including the hippocampus and cortices provides the structure necessary for synthetic logic. Synchronization in multi-hierarchical system is proposed to be an important neural principle to evaluate the consistency of the circulation loop in such a hierarchical system,
