Miniature excitatory synaptic currents were recorded from CA1 pyramidal cells in hippocampal slices to study the site of the persistent change in synaptic efficacy during long-term potentiation. Induction of long-term potentiation produced a large increase in the amplitude of these currents. Such a change in amplitude suggests an increase in postsynaptic transmitter sensitivity.
