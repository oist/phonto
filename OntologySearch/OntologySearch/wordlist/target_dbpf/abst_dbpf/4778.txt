In order to compare the role of the fornix (FX) and cingulate cortex (CC) in memory, rats were trained in a series of discriminations using procedures that were the same as those used for monkeys (Murray et al. 1986, 1988). A spatial delayed nonmatching-to-sample (DNMS) discrimination tested recent memory for spatial location in a T maze using interrun intervals (IRI) that varied from 5 s to 15 min. FX and CC lesions produced a substantial impairment in the performance of this task during postoperative testing. Three conditional discriminations (CD) followed. In each one, the rat was presented with two objects, only one of which was correct. The nature of the conditional stimuli changed in each discrimination: the place of the maze in the room; the direction that the rat moved to approach the objects; the side (left or right) to which the rat turned. Control rats learned all three types of conditional discriminations. FX and CC lesions did not impair choice accuracy. In a subsequent repetition of the spatial DNMS procedure, FX and CC lesions again produced a substantial impairment, indicating that the lack of an impairment in the three CDs was not due to recovery of function. These data indicate that the hippocampal system and its connections through the fornix are importantly involved in spatial working memory in both rats and monkeys, and that the CDs do not require this type of memory. The results are discussed in the context of different theories of the brain mechanisms involved in memory.
