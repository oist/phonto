The rodent hippocampus has been thought to represent the spatial environment as a cognitive map. In the cognitive map theory, different spatial regions are assigned to different cell populations in the framework of rate coding. Recently, a relation between place cell firing and local field oscillation of the theta rhythm, what is called theta phase precession, was experimentally discovered and suggested a temporal coding mechanism leading to memory formation of behavioral sequences accompanied with asymmetric Hebbian plasticity. The classical cognitive map theory is apparently outside of the sequence memory view.
We have presented the theoretical framework of the temporal coordination of the neural firing in theta phase precession based on synchronization theory, which provides theta phase coding of on-line behavioral sequences. Our computational studies in a simple environment demonstrated that theta phase coding is inevitable for instantaneous memory formation of one-time experience and that the cognitive map can be formed after spatial exploration in only few minutes through behavioral episode encoding.
However, it is still unclear whether the computational theory is extensively available for real-time cognitive map formation in the real world environment. We hypothesized here that theta phase coding is not specific in rat navigation but should work either in human or in robot, and investigated the problem by using a mobile robot, Khepera, with colored cue conditions. We here demonstrate how the theoretical framework of theta phase coding endows real-time process of memory integration of behavioral experiences in the real environment. This approach bridges a gap between neuroscience and the robotics to enlighten the importance of temporal coordination in our real-time cognition.
