In this paper, we propose a moving object detection algorithm for the advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) and its digital VLSI implementation. The algorithm is based on parallel processing inspired by neuronal propagation underlying sequence coding in a model of the hippocampus. We have implemented this algorithm on an FPGA, and have verified the desired operation: detection of the velocity and direction of moving objects at real time.
