In a recent experiment, Foster and Wilson [1] have observed reverse replay of behavioral sequences in rodents' hippocampal place cells during non-running awake state in coincidence with sharp waves. In this paper, to elucidate this reverse replay mechanism, a theta phase precession computational model is assumed in one time trial learning experiment of a behavioral sequence. Our simulations demonstrate that reverse replay can occur during sharp waves states under the assumption that place cells' excitability is elevated by reward. This reward induced reverse replay in the hippocampus might serve as a basis for reinforcement learning.
