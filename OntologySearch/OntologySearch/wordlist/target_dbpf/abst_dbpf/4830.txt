Theta Rhythm
A set of compartmental models of CA1 pyramidal, granular and polymorph cells of the dorsal hippocampus have been used to simulate membrane potentials generated by synaptic activation at various levels along these cells. From the membrane potential distributions the field potentials in dorsal CA1 and the dorsal blade of the dentate area have been simulated using a model based on volume conduction theory. Field potential profiles similar to laminar profiles, found experimentally in the dorsal hippocampus during theta rhythm, could only be simulated by assuming (almost) simultaneous synaptic excitation of the 3 cell types at given sites. The results lead to 2 alternative models for the simultaneous excitation of CA1 pyramidal cells and dentate granular cells during theta rhythm. Other electrophysiological evidence favours the model in which the two neuronal populations are activated distally near the fissure.
